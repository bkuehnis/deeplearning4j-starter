I can't go back to sleep again.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
You what?
Kristen, what happened?
You in a hurry?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
I know.
We have matching luggage.
You've been up all night?
Then you saw him, too?
No...
You're his sister, right?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
In her dream?
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
Kristen's story really got to her.
I've been working double shifts.
Extra money, huh?
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
How long have you been awake?
Three days.
You were contracted to work-
Let me see the sick.
There is no reason for fear.
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee-
Morning, friend, glorious day.
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
-careful, Abdullah-
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
You've never built in Africa.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
Not really.
Is there something we can do?
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Don't they, though?
So work must be going well?
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
But overall, you're pleased?
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
Yes he is.
Well, I need to speak to him.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
I'm calling it my contraption- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
What?
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told you you'd hate me.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Who?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.
You don't enjoy killing, do you?
You never had it.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
You just feel sorry for me.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
Very good indeed.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
He just gave me his monster speech.
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Have you got that in writing?
Does he speak English?
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done.
Finish your tour?
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
I couldn't believe it when you said sort it out. As if it were the most normal thing in the world. Ho-hum
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
It's okay, we're just about there.
You said of course you'd need the donkey. Why of course?
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
I don't suppose I could watch.
Might be exciting for you.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
What?
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
...one shot...
So that's what a lion looks like.
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
How lucky we are.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
Possibly.
All right- thee second embankment will go there.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -there.
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
John, it will not be easy.
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands-
But you said they were always old.
Second death? Where?-
But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
What a good week.
We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Got me out of trouble.
We need to talk.
Actually, no.
Somehow I guessed.
That's very considerate.
I can try.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
...misfire... it jammed...
...don't know...
Have you ever failed?
Goddammit!
But of course yours worked.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn...
Here we are.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
What happened to them?
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
I'll be bait alone?
I'll have to.
Was that supposed to make me feel better?
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Why?
How many do you think they've killed?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge.
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
The workers don't get on?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them.
Did it look like this in your mind?
This is more difficult-
What the hell was that?
I am also liaison between these two.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
What are they looking at?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
For you.
Good news?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
I do, actually; very much.
You give me hope, John.
Soon.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
He has children?
Once...
You look great!
Save it for later.  Come on!
Where is it?
Underneath.  Somewhere.
Afraid of lions.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit-
I don't believe you had a mother.
They will want a lot of money.
Why so many?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Rick, please.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
It was Freddy.
Hey, Rick!
I don't get it.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
So?
Nice neighborhood.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
About Freddy?
It's okay, Dan
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
What are you talking about?  My condition?...
You're not taking my baby!
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
My name is...
How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Is that who you're waiting for?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
Who said I...wait, what?
Who says I don't like you?
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
The tickets.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Yeah...I guess.
You're right.
Me too.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Dad!
To take a picture.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
It's just across the park.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
How was the meeting?
Very funny.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
You disappointed in me?
I've got to go.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
What's that got to do with it?
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Krueger is reality.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Are you alright?
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
You think that's the place she's buried?
If they actually bothered to bury her.
What?
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
But how are we gonna --
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
So did Dan.
He sure loves to stay awake.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Well we gotta do something!
I've got to write some of this down.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Mark, are you okay?
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
Then get out!
Mark!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Nobody thinks that.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Hi, Bobo.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
Who's Jacob?
What, you named it already?
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
I want to keep my teeth.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Bobo, no, I --
My son --
My son was in the hospital --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
Motherhood.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You expect me to buy this?
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
You're calling the shots.
No.
I'll loan you a raincoat.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
And if you do it wrong?
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
What's that, Lilly?
Permanent damage.
You'll never shit right again.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
You want a drink?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
You're a thousand percent right!
You know it, Lilly.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
I don't know!
Roy? He's always crying.
I like you, too.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
Fine.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
Goody!
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
So here we are!
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
We're not really interested, Henry.
Henry, no!
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
What? He's going to be all right!
Well, make it stop!
You know who I work for.
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
Then we'll find another way.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
What is?
But they must be! They cut glass!
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
All right.
It's not your fault.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Roy Dillon.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
Lead on.
They think I'm nuts.
Sounds like a good Idea.
What? Me?
Well, uh... No.
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Oh, sure. Fine.
Perk.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
Fair enough.
Only one arm?
They knocked out my tooth!
Only one tooth?
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
I guess I owe you my life.
What happened to your hand?
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Meaning?
I like those.
How come?
Not as tough as you, huh?
No. And you have to be.
Up to you.
Sure.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
Bluebell came in?
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
I tripped over a chair.
Why?
You don't have the stomach for it.
That's right.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
But I've seen her grave.
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
What's that?
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I pay my debts.
You do?
Expecting visitors?
You ought to put a bandage on that.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
You, too, Roy.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
Well, that's good news.
Going somewhere?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I've really got to --
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
Myra followed you, huh?
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No.
As though you do what I say.
That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
This way's perfect.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Poor woman...
No shit.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
At what?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
What?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know you do, so that's why --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
No.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I'll get it.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
Not very good!
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
Uh-huh.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
Never.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
For God's sake, Lilly!
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
No.
You're getting off the grift?
That's right.
I don't?
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
I don't see why not.
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
Well, uh...
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
A future. The only future I've got.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
Just trying to help, Lilly.
What?
I don't understand.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
There's nothing more to talk about.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
NO!
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Joe, you know you'll --
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
We'll work something out, Joe.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
Let me see how you did that one.
I can't. I just left home.
In your other hand.
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Always, for you, baby.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Taking you for granite?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
My undying love.  Have some.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Let's find out.
Roy?
Mm?
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
No more than this?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
I want to know everything about you.
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
Mama!
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
That's just Lilly's way.
Oh, don't be stupid.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
Get well soon.
Every day in every way.
I'll see you when you get home.
Because it's comfortable.
We'll rent a car.
Big spender.
You ain't seen nothin.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
You already went back to work.
What?
Working the what?
Oh, come on, Roy.
The tap. What you do for a living.
I'm a salesman.
Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I've heard the name.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Is that right?
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Yeah? How?
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Atascadero.
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just...
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Think about it. Okay?
Sure.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Yeah?
Open your door.
What?  What for?
Open it and find out.
You -- I don't know.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
Oh, come here.
You were gone for a while.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
I don't think I need it.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
Maybe I like it where I am.
Don't I get any say in this?
What?
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
For Christ's sake, why not?
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
Bullshit!
No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you.
What is it? What's going on?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
) What?
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
You watch that mouth.
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Roy Dillon?
Yes?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
That's natural.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Gun?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
You up to it now?
Sure. Let's get it over.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
What?
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Ate the gun. Oh.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
Not many.
Oh, Jesus.
No question, huh?
No, its -- Why did she--?
That's that, then.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
Mr. Simms.
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
Makes you look like a nun--
Do I know you?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Detective...
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
A dead body?
Do you know who did this?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still no.
You're so predictable.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
And I should have a son who calls me Mom.  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
No.
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Forget it.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
My life is a living hell.
Where are you going?
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
I thought you'd never ask.
I know.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Nothing.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Just forget it...
Will, sit down...
You some kind of fugitive or something?
I was trying to get away from someone.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Now you're joking, right?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Yes.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
He found you, didn't he?
Get on the bus.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?
John...
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Please, get on the bus...
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Why not?
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
I came to see you.
Can I come in?
Then you come out here.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
You look kind of cold.
Better?
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's John, isn't it?
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
This kid just wants his freedom.
It's not going to happen.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Doesn't make it bad advice.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Bye Will.
Hey, you alright?
What?
What are you looking at?
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
What?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
He's my brother.
I can't believe this is happening.
Shit happens.
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
Are you going to leave, too?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Yeah.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
Keri, you all right?
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
All of us.  Right?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
Vomit?
Faint.
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
I've come to help your family.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
Mark...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I can't listen to this.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
It's okay.
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
But surely Rogers isn't --
Retiring.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
You, too?
He invited me to his house last night.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
Or what's left of him.
It's a sign.  He's come home.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
An old friend.
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
I'll meet you over there.
Where's the child?
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
This is madness, Wynn.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Jamie's baby ...
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Samhain.
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
How is he - ?
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
And they thought you could re- place the Skipper?
You've created a monster.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
No!!!
Stay away, Sam.
Leave the boy.  Take me.
Yes?
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
What do you know about Michael?
No one.
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
You could train someone else.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I wanted to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
What is it?
Your 'out.'  This came for you.
My father!  He's not - ?
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
You said it.  But I won't argue -
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, Commander!  It just so happens I'm not a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
That may be.  But Dad stays where he is, and I'm staying here!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to school to spend my life at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - that strikes me as the worst cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You mean nothing is worth fighting for?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win those by fighting wars, and I'll show you an idiot!
You may not win them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, long ago!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm not a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either I take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
I'd sooner swim!
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Yes?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
But if they do?
I don't know.
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
So they caught up with you, too?
Disappointing a big girl!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
I might have a son like that!
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
But they're not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Cyclops?
We're stuck tight!
'Us?'
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
You know - it is?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we will be, soon.
You hear that?
Somewhere down there?
We'll have to look for them later.
Well?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Yes!
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
He... he loved me.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
You a doctor, too?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
God, that's terrible.
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
I... I had a visitor.
What?
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
If anyone can help, HE can.
No bad dreams.
So you slept O.K.?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
And you're sure it was a woman?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
The box. I need the box.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
What?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Get out of the way.
Are you crazy?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
WHY?
Because I'm going to get my father!
O.K. Let's go.
Kyle, you don't have...
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
What are you talking...
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Well... G'bye.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
I've come for my father!
And what about you?
Wait!
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
You were ALL human!
Where am I?
Steve...
What are you talking about? Who are you?
I thought Steve had talked to you?
He talked about Demons, huh?
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
The Cenobites.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
Who with?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did that happen?
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
After torpedo room:  Report!
You're sure it's Cyclops?
Thirty-four seconds!
Right at him?
But - what can we accomplish?
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark and Cyclops right to the bottom.
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
Come where?
That's a face???
Tell me something:  Why can I hear you, when the others couldn't?
for horrors like yourself?
Swell!
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
Why?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
That might be a little rough!
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
No. Black.
Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Twombley involved?
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
What are you boys up to?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Tell me.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
I plan to. Soon.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Yes.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
You see it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
He's on to us!
You can't buy Wade off.
That was me.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Damn straight!
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Wonderful!
I'm okay.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
You played for the Sox?
Pitcher. Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk.
They said.
Hmm.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Safety on?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Don't mind if I do.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
No brag. Just fact.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
Not here.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
How'd you get the job?
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Shit.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
What?
Saw him do it?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Yeah.
He sure as hell won't.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Open the door, will ya?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
I don't care. They're out.
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
I just think you used to be bad.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's stupid.
It's fun.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
No.
No what?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? Yes.
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Dad.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Oh.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Okay.
Fine.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
You can't.
That's illegal, you know.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Oh.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
Okay, let's go home, then.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Fuck you.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
What's the hurry?
Huh?
I figured you already heard.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Like hell.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Something bugging you?
I'm fine, fine.
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
What do I have to do for it?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You? Why?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
Yeah.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
We should talk.
It's just...
Yeah, lots.
Hi honey.
No problem. Look, I...
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
I know who it is.
Mel Gordon.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
For a while.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Money.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
But not now.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
You knew me as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
It's nice.
Then... I guess you have to.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Oh, Wade.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You've been married twice --
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Good.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Strange.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Wade.
What happened?
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Going somewhere, Margie?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
You're not using it today?
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
When did she die?
Can --?
How's that?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Yes. Here's your ticket.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
It don't look right.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with Home Made Cooking, that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Jack?
Where... how'd you hear that?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
His office. You mean my old office.
He got his deer yet?
Rolfe.
Nothing.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
You remember Margie Fogg?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Yeah.
Where's Ma?
Yeah.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Call it what you want.
Yeah.
You and me.
Crawl!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Rolfe.
Wade?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
No shit.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Huh?
How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about Margie?
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Find them everywhere.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Not particularly.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
That's what you think.
No.
You lived like this once.
My name is Robert.
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
Are you all right?
How much do you remember?
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
Do you remember where you lived?
What about... now?
Yes.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
My wife.
Yes.
Do you remember where it is?
Where you lived with them.
Yes.
What choice did I have -- ?!
I only protect myself -- !
If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
What do you mean?
For what?
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
Who?
That's who you are too, Emma.
Yes.
Emma...
Shhh... don't talk.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Stay alive.
Yes.
You and that damned garden.
I surrender --
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Virginia...?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Please.
That's fine.
Hell of a night.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
What do you want?
You have to leave the White House.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
You're being paranoid.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
What?
Connie, don't hang up.
David? How'd you get this number?
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
What do you want me to do?
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
He's not going to listen to me.
David, don't...
Just my luck, no ice.
I take it you've heard.
A toast to the end of the world.
You still believe in him.
He's a good man.
Better be. You left me for him.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
Did it work?
You bet it did.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Spunky. He told you about that?
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
More than likely.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
I'll bet.
You saved a lot of lives.
We're losing them.
Then get them out of there.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
So sue me.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
There's good news and bad news.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
That's the good news?
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
Haven't you been watching?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
What happened?
Just do it!
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Not really...
That signal. It's a countdown.
A countdown to what?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Then what?
Checkmate.
I'm thinking.
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
Dad, don't start.
Three years.
You still got the Olds?
That's okay. You're driving.
They don't know this.
Dad...
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
College nickname.
She didn't take my name when we were married.
Perfect, she's using it.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
He wasn't the President then.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
Dad, please...
I'm making a mess.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
We'll meet you there.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Great.
What the hell are you doing?
Just getting a feel for her.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Get us out of here!
I can't shake her free.
What're you doing?
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
You as well.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I had a feeling you would.
Then God help us.
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
Is my wife in the air?
Any news on my wife?
Where are they?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
And our forces?
We're being exterminated.
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
And our troops here?
But what, General?
Then find them.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
Grey, you read me?
Roger.
He's doing a good job.
You can't go. Call them back.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Wait. I have to tell you something.
What?
Be careful.
Really? You don't mind?
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Yes, I am.
Dick-weed!
Butt-munch.
You're late.
You're late.
You know me...
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
I should have done this a long long time ago.
You scared the hell out of me.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
Butt-munch.
He's my angel.
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
I'm a dancer.
No. Exotic.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
Hey, you guys back already?
I shouldn't have left her.
Damn it!
Command, Eagle One. Switching to sidewinders. We're moving in.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
So push it!
Jimmy, stay with me.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
We're leaving.
Above American soil?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Deploy.
Call them back.
I said call them back.
Alice!
Yes.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Can they be killed?
Why did you people come here?
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
And before here?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
What do you want us to do?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
My reputation precedes me.
Yes.
Alice... I...
Yes.
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
May we go home now, please?
You've got it!
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
All your life.
All my life!
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
Your treat.
Yes. My treat.
What has the old fool got himself into now?
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
Dad?
Venice, Italy!
What is it?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Do you believe, Marcus?
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
How you doing, sweetie?
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Ah, Venice...
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
That doesn't look much like a library.
It looks like a converted church.
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Dad was onto something here!
How's the head?
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.  But where exactly?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
I'm going after Dad.
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Marcus!
Arghhh! Oh!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
Henry, the pen --
What?
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
Look what you did!
It's war.
The Word of God...
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
The Name of God...
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Schneider?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
How dare he?!
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
Where did this come from?
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
An old man's dream.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
Let me tell you another bedtime story
Not supposedly
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two markers that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those markers. It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second marker is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
You could be more right than you know.
Yes?
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
DONOVAN!
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
I'm through!
We're through!
Doctor Jones?
Yes?
I knew it was you --
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Lower me down.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
The Ark of the Covenant.
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
It must be one of these...
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
What's that?
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
What?
I said go around!
You said go between them!
I said don't go between them!
My room!
Mine, too.
What were they looking for?
This.
The Grail Diary.
Uh-huh.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
At least I let you tag along.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No?
No. You like the way I do things.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
What are you going to do?
Don't know. Think of something.
This one. I think he's in here.
How do you know?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
How did you get here?
Where is it? I want it.
You came back for the book? Why?
My father didn't want it incinerated.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
You do.
All I have to do is squeeze.
All I have to do is scream.
I never expected to see you again.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Out!
It's important!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Junior!
It is you Junior!
But what are you doing here?
I came to get you! What do you think?
Got it.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I'll never forgive myself --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Thank God!
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Good point.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
Right.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
...you did it.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Rats?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Yeah?
Well, uh...
You did!!
Look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Will you take it easy!
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
I came here to save you.
No! Don't Shoot!
Umh?
She talks in her sleep.
So did I.
Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
What am I looking for?
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
It's cut.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
The floor's on fire! See?!
What???
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
Dad!
What?
Dad!
What?
Dad!
What?
Head for the fireplace!
Oh.
This is intolerable!
I'm out, Dad!
Dad!
...the solution presents itself.
Come on, Dad. Come on!
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
Stop!
What?
Stop! Stop!
Brody's this way.
My Diary's in Berlin.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
All right Dad -- tell me.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
What final challenge?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Booby traps?
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
What did you get?
Good.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Relax.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
And do I detect a rebuke?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
When?
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Dad, how can you?
Very well. I'm here now.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  First
What does that mean?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
What happens at eleven o'clock?
Dad, are we hit?!
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Nice landing.
Thanks.
Those people are trying to kill us!
I know, Dad!
It's a new experience for me.
You read my mind.
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad, we're well out of range.
Now, who are all these people?
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
Dad?
You call this archaeology?
Get out of there, Dad!
Dad?!
Junior...
Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The penitent man is humble before God.
Penitent. Penitent...
The penitent man is humble...
But in the Latin alphabet, Jehovah begins with an I.
J.
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
Me?... Illumination.
What did you find, Junior?
Junior?! Dad...
I like Indiana.
We named the dog Indiana.
Ready?
After you, Junior.
Yes, sir!  Haaa!
Who are you?
That was seven hundred years ago.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Come on -- come on!
I'm going after those horses.
I don't need camels.
No camels!
Where's my father?
Got it.
Why are you trying to kill us?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Then we'll die.
Who are you?
And why were you trying to kill me?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
How we doing, Colonel?
Uh, we got a problem here.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
What's new?
Yeah? What for?
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs don't breathe any more of that dust in.  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Where?
That remote control thing?
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Just ran into two of your geologists. Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
How long?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
P.J.'s.
Push it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
When's the air date?
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Get me Wigand.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Good.
Do you want more rice?
How about you?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
Tortious interference? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
Lunch?
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on 60 Minutes?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Over my dead body.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear reasonable and tortious interference. I hear... Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse. I hear... Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...! That's what I hear.
You're exaggerating!
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
So, what are you going to do?
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
You're taking no for an answer?
No. I'm not going to take no for an answer. No.
Then what are you going to do?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
What the hell are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
I'm not touching my film...
No, I'm not...
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
What caliber is my gun?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
...my files! Personal correspondence...
That computer has everything...
Debbie...
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch ya' later.
No, no, we're fine...
How grave?
Mike?
What does that mean? Rife with -- ?
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Well, as a standard... I'll hang with is the guy telling the truth?
Come again?
Is this Alice in Wonderland?
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Catch you later.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Yeah?
Why?
You ready...?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
I can take her.
Don't you have to be at the office?
Is there any more rice...?
Yes, it's on the stove...
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Try the car.
Stop.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Uh, what are those boxes?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
What do you need at the store?
Soy sauce...
Right now?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
Why? Who said?
Thomas Sandefur...
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
No, thank you.
What's going on?
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the F up, they were going to kill you...
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Use the bathroom.
What's the difference...
That's for food.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Yes... Jeffrey.
Thank you, Bob.
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with 60 Minutes...
Yeah.
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Let me call you back...
No classes this morning?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
...ignition propensity?  ...you understand any of this...?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
...it's anonymous. References to P.M.  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
I have to take a shower.
What's wrong?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
I'm alone on this...
Oh, baby...
Jeffrey Wigand...
Jeffrey...
I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.' You know, you take the 60 Minutes out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? 60 Minutes? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
I got perspective.
No, you do not.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
Yeah...
Who is this?
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Area code 212-555-0199.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah, I'm here.
We're there.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
You eating with us?
What Seven Dwarfs?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
Well, it isn't cigarettes are bad for you...
Hardly new news.
No shit.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
What do you mean?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were compelled?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Thank you for saying that...
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
Oh, man.
Who are these people?
Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Good.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
What?
Lowell.
Put the corporation at risk...? Give me a fucking break!
Lowell.
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
What?
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is no. I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
Yeah.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
Did I get you up?
Hold on, Alice.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Yeah, that's right.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Oh, please, Mike...
Give me a break!
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?  What future? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
Mike... in my...
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Everything interests me.
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
Yeah... Thank you.
What I've seen... I've liked.
No. We don't do that.  You've seen 60 Minutes and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
Who's that?
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Black, black...
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
I know what I have to know.
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
...but that's as far as I go...
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Did work.
Did work.
How much would I get paid?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
If you want to do it.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Fuck you, too!
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Good. I want to talk to you.
What do...
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
They should be.
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Like what?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the zone...?
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for tobacco in the first place?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
The new place? New.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
Good.  You have kids?
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
...okay.
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Hello. You there
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
It's okay.
Tempura...
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Next to your father?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
You charge by the hour?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on 60 Minutes
Why?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
You believe that?
No.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
You believe that?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
I don't think you really understand --
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or 60 Minutes' with this cheap skepticism!
Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
I'll call them, Lowell.
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
Lowell, I can't afford --
...they volunteered. A friend owns a large security company.
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
I heard.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
Did you have a good day?
Yeah, great.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
What's changed?
You mean... since this morning?
No. I mean since whenever...
Run that Sandefur piece on nicotine's not addictive. Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with I believe they perjured... Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word felt on the B-side...
They've gotta be joking.
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
What?!
No.
No? No, what?
I do not think that you know for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
I told the truth!
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint...  Any other questions?
What?
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
ABC...?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
I told the truth... I told the truth.
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
You manipulated me into this...!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You greased the rails!
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know. Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
Where are you, anyway?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
Did he hear you?
What about now?
Hello, can you hear me now?
What's happening?!
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
She's okay.
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
There is -- there is no family.
Liane has filed for divorce...
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
The process is known as impact boosting... While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as ammonia chemistry. It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called coumarin. When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
Poor communication skills.
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it... I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it.
When should we do this?
Jail?
How does one... go... to... jail? What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Seven...
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Chapter and verse.
Is that a threat?
You threatening my family, now, too?
Research...  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
Got it.
That isn't necessary.
Can't it wait?
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
You know what?
I wish it were that easy...
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
Please... don't start with me.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Someone should give you a raise.
Did they say anything about my family?
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
What's going on?
But...
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
This is the President.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
I might still have a few chips left.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Other way around, sir.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Did we tape the Duke game?
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
You give me ulcers.
That's my job.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
Sir...
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
Not one word.  That's an order.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this Clay Bertrand and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Street cats?
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
What was his voice like?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Did he pay?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
And Oswald?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
Who?
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Shit.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty-five years.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew...
Yeah, I guess you do.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
No, I'm not...
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
What do you think, Lou?
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
You, Numa?
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  To leave this life is
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
You know you keep saying that.
Keep saying what?
You're not digging.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Gee, thanks boss.
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - a patsy.  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, O.H. Lee to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
But why?
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
IT'S OPEN!
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Can you get some sworn statements?
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a White Paper - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  When you receive this
All right, all right.  Break it up.
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
There's a word - orders.
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Julius Caesar:  Brutus and Cassius
This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
What's it look like, Nick?
WE'RE HOOKED!
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
No, I did not.
No, I did not.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
No, I did not.
You know damn well who it is.
Dave?
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
Calm down, Dave, what?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
...give me protection?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but Im in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out Alan Pope in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called Mongoose  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  Oh
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
What was so appealing about Houston?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Why Galveston?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
And then Sunday?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I believe the boys got a couple.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Why?  What's wrong?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Who was paying you, Dave?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Shaw's an untouchable, man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
What about Ruby?
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
Then who killed the President?
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
There were admirals.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Hi, Freckle Face.
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying We both know who's responsible.  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name Oswald to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name Oswald to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word microdots in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill.
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
I wouldn't imagine where.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
A Perry Russo?
No.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering Frankie! .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
David Ferrie.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
Let me show you his picture.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Nonsense.  What next?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
Hi.
Tough day.
My sympathies.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, Where's Daddy?  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Did they live?
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
What?
A man just called.  He asked her everything!
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Get a hold of yourself.
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and I'm jes fine honey.  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not fine about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
And if you're wrong?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
I don't think so, Jim...
Huh?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
For sexual purposes?
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
What's wrong, Lou?
Oh no!... How bad?
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
I know David - a strange character.
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Take a look across the street.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
Once ONI, always ONI?
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
What are you driving at, boss?
We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
Can we find her?
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
Goddamn Sam!
And it ain't pretty  ...the AD has spent more than $8
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Time?
Between six and seven seconds.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
How many men?
One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... 3-2-1...  green!  Or else Abort!  Abort!
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, and afterwards there's only the freeway
You know who the mayor was?
No.
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a traitor.  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
The Warren Commission call him?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Allen Dulles?
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
They're gonna love you, chief.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
You think there were other men involved, Russell?
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Yes.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Well, thanks for coming.
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
...and your General?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
Ever ask him?
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
His name?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say protection but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of okay signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
And he never hit you before?
Never touched me.
How much more?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
You have other information?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
Where is Banister in all this?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
You're so naive, mister.
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, The Old Man and the Sea?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Germany.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
That's it.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
And what would I have to do?
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
This looks pretty good on me.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
But then you told her you were home.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
Then say Yes
I'll call her.
I won't forget.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Who was there for your ass?
Who?
You.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
That's why they call it fuckin' with ya. Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
What'd ya mean?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
What?
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
What's the problem?
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Go ahead.
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
I can't believe you do me this way.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Course you didn't.
But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
In his inside coat pocket.
Why were you with him?
How'd you know where he was?
I found out.
And you didn't tell the Police?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Great, you're here.
Hey, Jackie.
She sound scared?
She wants to go back to work.
What's she willing to give us?
She knows it's my case?
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
We are. Don't worry about it.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
What time do you have to be there?
Can I have a word with you?
Sure.
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
You have the right to say no. And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Suspicion of what?
This is your money?
If I were to tell you no it isn't...
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
I'm not saying another word.
Arrest me.
I'm not a loser.
Help yourself.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
My pocketbook.
What's in it?
Beauty products.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Take your time.
Thanks.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
But now you're telling us now you do.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
You don't want much, do you?
Can you do it or not?
How was your flight?
Fine.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
But you're not going to stop her?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Okay.
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Who do you think I am?
I gave you my card there.
Can I see your I.D.?
You're serious?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
Is it dark?
It's kind of a sports bar
That doesn't sound dark.
Why does it need to be dark?
Great.
You gain weight?
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
What's your brand?
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
Was she helpful?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
You're not tired of it?
I am, as a matter of fact.
What have they told you?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Shit.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
Sure.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. Oh
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
What did they want to know?
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
Ordell pick up his bond?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
I didn't?
No, you didn't. What branch?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
He's the one who wants you.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
How many trips did you make?
With ten thousand? Nine.
He's got that kinda money?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Cash poor?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
What'dya think?
If you're having some.
You get a chance to use it?
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
What, I couldn't hear you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Somebody loan it to you?
Yeah.
Want to hear some music?
Sure.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
This is pretty.
Who is this?
The Delfonics.
'74, I think.
It's nice.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
Are you?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
We talked.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
How do you get it out?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
How do you feel about getting old?
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's not really something I think about.
Really?
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
It's different with men.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
My ass ain't the same.
Bigger?
Yeah.
Does something else worry you?
Fifteen thousand.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
Well, hello.
Surprise.
I walked right past you.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Catching a movie.
What'd ya see?
American President
How was it?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
Does it happen to all men?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
And Annette's it for you?
Who was your girl before Annette?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in Speed. She's cute.
Why?
I'm old enough to be her father.
How old's Annette?
I don't care.
What're you, a bag lady?
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
You don't actually do it that way?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Right around here, in the food court.
Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
Will Ordell go for that?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I called you last night.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
You think he's got a thing for you?
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
I see.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
You know some interesting people.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
He tries to act cool.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
What about you Max?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
You're avoiding the question.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
When did you decide?
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
The day you got me out of jail?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Uh-huh.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
What do you do when he comes home?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
You do that?
Did you do it that night?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind
And is that it?
More or less.
Which one?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
The feds. It's evidence.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
You're rationalizing.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Do you think they bought it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
It'll be more than that.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Where's the rest of it?
In the bag underneath.
What if he checks it?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
In a dress.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
How'd you find out?
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
He's liable to shoot you.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
Ray wants him.
It's not that simple.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Uh-huh.
Tell him you want to see him?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Why?
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
What do you tell Nicolet?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I'm sure.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
What's he doing?
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is woefully and wantonly selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I told him I might.
That's Ordell's.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
Not after they're dead.
I didn't say you did.
I never lied to you.
I know.
We're partners.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
You'll get over that.
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Wanna go?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Are you scared of me?
Who's side are you on?
What if I plead guilty?
Do you live together?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Yeah?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
What the fuck is that shit?
I know what it looks like.
You planted that shit on me.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
Can I smoke?
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
We can look into that.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
You know what we want.
If I'm working, I can help you.
Oh, so now you know him?
You never asked me if I did or not.
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
He sells guns.
You ever see him sell guns?
No.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
How can you help us?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
I'm recording this.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
You two meet?
You talk to him?
Not really.
What for?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.
Who's the other one?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
What's her story?
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
And splittin' with her?
What did you say?
She told you that?
Was she there?
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
We could, if I'm not in jail.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
You didn't count it?
Ever been tempted?
Uh-huh.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
That would be one point of view.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
Si.
I thought I did.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
But you didn't do that.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.
Where's the bag she gave you?
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
What did you do after that?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I have no idea.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
So what happens now?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
What about me?
What about you?
Do you think I took some of that money?
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
Oh, hi.
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Great...  ...Wanda!
Uh-uh.
Gimme one anyway.
He told me to go outside.  You may leave us now. It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be the man. You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
He said he didn't know about it.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
Beaumont Livingston?
You already knew that?
Kinda.
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
You think I'm kidding?
Dreaming.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Keep it between us girls?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Hi, Melanie.
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah, do you like it?
It looks good on you.
Do you got something for me?
You betcha.
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I was expecting you. Come in.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Got some o.j.?
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
Sure.
For what?
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
They asked.
And what was your answer?
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Beaumont Livingston.
I knew it.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
What do you think it is?
What the hell you doin'?
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
I understand woman, damn!
Go sit over in that chair.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
I just came here to talk.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Baby, I didn't --
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
I got a problem...
Yeah.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
Talk to you tomorrow.
The Cockatoo Inn.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
It's a cockatoo.
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
I do okay.
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
How the fuck they know that?
I told them.
You told em? You told em it's me?
They already know it's you.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
You told them that?
It's true, isn't it?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
What did they say?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
Who?
I don't know. One of your friends.
A woman.
Yeah, I think a woman.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
But you don't?
No, I give it to someone else first.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
That's the idea.
So we need two people, two women.
Can you cover that?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Managers get ten percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I'll give ya ten.
Plus the same deal as before.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Uh-huh.
What'd you care?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
Drink?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
How do you know she did that?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Man, I don't like that part.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.
What does she think she's gettin?
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Designer clothes.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Where you gonna be during all this?
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
Who's paging you?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
It's boring, isn't it?
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Want a hit?
Sure.
Four days ago.
Where at?
Susanville.
How long?
Four years?
Uh-huh.
Bank robbery.
Really, I'm impressed.
Is it ready to go?
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
Want a Metrix?
What's a Metrix?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
No thanks.
Which one?
The roller disco one.
Fourteen.
Yeah.
I thought you were sixteen.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Were you a disco girl?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
So where did you go?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
That was taken at a place called Flippers. It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
No.
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
We had done time together already.
Were you a disco guy?
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
Did you ever go I one?
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.
You lived in Japan, when?
Who's arm is that?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Must of made quite an impression.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
That sounds like a problem.
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
Wanna fuck?
Sure.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Is it dead?
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
No.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Does that bother you?
Please.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Uh-huh?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
And your point is?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
...and just take it from him.
We're leaving now!
All right already.
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Are you sweating?
What are you doin'?
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Lemme have the bag.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
This one.
You sure?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Okay, Lou-is.
Thanks, Baby.
Who's your partner?
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on New York Undercover uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
What's your cost?
As low as two.
Are you serious?
That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
That's good money.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Which one is for the car?
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
What do I do?
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go bleep. That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Okay.
Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Whatcha watchin'?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
I dunno.
The moon -- I dunno
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
You're outside?
Uh-huh.
C'mon in.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
I'm in my underwear.
Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
Who was that?
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
What did he do?
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
How much is there?
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
Sure.
What's your relationship?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say thank you and I'll tell you, you're welcome.
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
Yep.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
What does that mean?
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Uh-huh.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.
Did you get it?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. Is it this aisle Lou- is
I shot her.
You shot Melanie?
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You shot her twice?
Uh-huh.
Pretty sure.
Where did you shoot her?
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
Louis?
What?
Where's the rest of it?
How much it there?
You said five hundred and fifty!
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Came outta where?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Then what?
We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.
That's right.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Pull the car over.
What'd you shoot her with?
It's in there.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Maybe the Feds got it.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Jesus Christ.
What?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Tell me.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
You gonna tell me who it was?
Max Cherry.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
How am I supposed to know that?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
I'm going out for a few hours.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
They don't have your winning personality.
I think I do. Is that good enough?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
He's a big one. You two tight?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Gonna have to put up cash.
You have it with you?
It's in my bag.
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
I know that.
Who's it for? A relative?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up possession of a concealed weapon. Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
You think you could do that?
What's his full name?
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Getting there.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
You don't say.
Haven't a clue.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
I need your name and address.
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
House or apartment?
Now I need you to count your money.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I?
Comfortable?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
I can see that. Why?
I got some more business for ya.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
It still sounds high.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
Somebody already did.
What?
You didn't hear?
Hear what?
Did the police contact you?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
What does she do for you?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said if -- it was just her shit to get high with.
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
Where is it?
Is that what I think it is?
What's up with this shit.
You know who this is?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
She got off, huh?
You still there?
I thought you might be asleep.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
I'm alone.
Git your ass in here.
That's all?
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
How'd you find me?
Winston found you.
How the fuck did he find me?
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Well, give it to me then.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
This place stinks.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
My office.
And where's Jackie?
She's been there since Thursday night.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She was afraid.
That I gotta see.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Have her bring the money here.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Call her, tell her the combination.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Uh-huh.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
She's all alone.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
She will.
It's the next street.
I know where it is.
Turn left.
I know where to turn.
My money's in that office, right?
Uh-huh.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yes.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
You know it's for you.
Who is it?
We're back.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
He leave town?
Give me his home number.
Get me out of here.
Take me home.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
I'm alive.
Let me out of here!
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
No, thanks.
Della?
Just to see you. That's all.
Like Della.
Hello, Sam.
I'm okay.
No, don't. But thanks.
Oh God!
Stop!!!!
I could have told you that.
It's short, huh?
Just my luck.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
That's right. We did.
It's hard to explain.
Well, try, huh.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
There's nothing to expose.
They're not interested, Jake.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Don't bother to call again, okay?
It was the window.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
I am.
I'm too messed up to teach.
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
Used you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
He told me he was going to Hell.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
A couple of weeks, I think.
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
... I've seen them, too.
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
How do you know?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other right?  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Who?
Sarah.
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She talk about the boys?
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
She hates me, Louis.
You should go back to her.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
I can't relax.
Wiggle your toes.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
I had this weird flash just then.
What?
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
I know.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
What are you doing?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
Jake, you need to rest.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
It's good to see you.
I haven't seen her in months.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Yes.
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
But I see them.
Hell, you think I am?
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
New? He's been here for years.
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Whataya mean, no record?
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
It's freezing.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
She was good in bed, though.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Save me!
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
They stole it.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
No. Don't move me.
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
Jake, is that you?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Where are you?
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
I moved the couch. That's all.
That help?
Thanks.
What do you think?
The room!
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
What happened to you?
Don't ask.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Thanks.  What's that?
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
I don't let anybody call me that.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Yeah, but for what?
A good lay.
And look what I got.
The best.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
What's in here?
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Lemme see.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
What?
Why you left.
What do you mean you can see?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
She looked good then.
Not to me.
Well, you didn't marry her.
Is that the one who died?
Ready?
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
Jake!
How's it going?
I'm going home.
What's wrong?
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
I enjoy crushing into you.
Why do you bring her up?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
When was the last time I said a word?
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
They're like demons, Jez.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
They weren't human!
Come on. What were they, Jake?
You okay?
Oh, come on. It's early.
We're at Della's.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Why? What for?
Show me Della!
Hey, I'm here.
Can't you stop it?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
What does it say?
How high is that?
The numbers stop at 107.
What the hell are you doin'?
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
What'd the doctor say?
He's coming right over.
Coming here?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
That's your decision.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
What kind of man are you?
Lie down!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Help me! Help me!
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Am I home?
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' Sarah
Are we in Brooklyn?
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
I love you, Jez.
I know.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Remember that.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
How come? The army?
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
He did? When?
Why didn't you call me?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
What? What do you mean?
What's he talking about?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
I don't believe this.
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
It's just me.
Who else were you expecting?
Let go!
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I want to know. You tell me!
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
Don't!
It might be for me.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
Who was that?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
How?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Me neither.
What's gotten into you?
It's so hard to believe.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
Stick with me, kid.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I can waitress. I'm good.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
I promise.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
I love you when you're angry.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Sit down.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
What's going on?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
WHO ARE YOU?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
Why won't you answer me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
You've lived with me for two years.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
You look upset.
I'm not upset.
I'm tired.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
You can have anything you want.
Then don't bug me.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Mid-town mostly.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Oh?  Where you going?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Sit down!
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Oh God!
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Goddamn you!
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
Long time ago.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Shows how much you knew.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
The Ladder?
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Who then?
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
So why tell me now?
Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
You come here often?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
Never?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
What is it?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I don't know.
One drop?
It's strong stuff.
Pleasant dreams.
I can't move.
Just relax.
What's happening? Help me.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
No. I couldn't.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
Where's Wong?
How was Palm Springs?
You got a nice tan, though.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Help me!
For what? For seeking the truth?
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
What is wrong with you?
What?!
Help me!
Call my chiropractor.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Where am I?
I'm awake?
That's a lie. My family was here.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Hello.
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
A long time.
Nothin' much.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
I need to see you, Jake.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
I need to see you.
I work in a bakery.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Still married, Jake?
Nope.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
What's wrong?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
What's goin' on Paul?
You in trouble?
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Who is?
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Why not?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I don't know what to do.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
What do you mean?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Everywhere, like a plague.
Oh God. I know. I know.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
The army?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
I don't know. I don't know.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
You come home with me.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
How did it happen?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Bring it in.
He doesn't like it.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
I want him out of the ocean.
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Just a favor for your old man.
Here --  Take him home.
Did you bring a check?
What?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
You got it.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
I know who he is...
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
What do you mean 'We...?'
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
You got it.
Who's driving the boat?
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
The wire's showing!
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
I never saw one that big.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
I almost had 'im.
What's that one, there?
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Where...?
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
Did you get him in the head?
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
What about us?
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Have you ever had one do this?
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Full throttle! To port!
He's comin' up -- !
He's taken him!
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Right.
Do you see the kids?
Probably out in the back yard.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Like you're from N'Yawk.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
I never hear the whistle.
Feed the dogs.
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Don't forget these.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
I think they make you look sexy.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Older, sillier.
Be careful.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Love ya.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Can you stand something to eat?
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Where is he?
He's sitting in it.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
How come you have to tell them that?
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
You too, sweetheart...
Can you do that?
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
Home... New York?
No. Home here.
Colorful, isn't he?
You going to be all right?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
What'll I tell the kids?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Now tell me something I don't know.
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
I didn't agree to that!
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Who's that young man?
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
She's right.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
I'm going home.
He lost it on the way up.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
Got a pen on you?
Why?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
Maybe we can save August...
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
My kids were on that beach...
Just sign it, Larry.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute.
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
No, we just checked the beach...
It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark.
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
What d'ya mean?
There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
Swell.
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Let's all have a drink.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
Rogue?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
You could say that.
What stinks so bad?
Our friend, the shark.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
What? What?!
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
How can you tell?
He ate a car?
...Nothing.
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
Chum?
What is all this stuff?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Where'd you get all this?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
They must've hit something.
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
Why don't we just tow it in?
You all right?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
No shark did that to a boat!
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
That means closing the beaches.
Wait a minute! I need you.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
I hope we get some more help.
I wish it would rain...
This has got to be one big violation...
This is quite a place.
What's that, a ship?
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
What the hell?
It's a whale out there.
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Quint...?
No...  You think we can get back with those?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
I can't imagine why.
Christine what?
You picked her up on the ferry.
Think she might've run out on you?
You from around here?
You here for the summer?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
Pretty stiff.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Get out of there Ã» take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
What else could've done that?
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
I'm responsible for public safety around here...
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Is anyone having this...?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
You love sharks?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Is that a boat?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Yep.
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
He's busy.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
Transplants?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Let me see your hands...
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Anti-Shark cage.
Who's inside, you or the shark?
What's that supposed to prove?
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
Let it go, don't waste your time.
Down here, Hooper!
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
I'm okay...
Fasten the pole.
Over there!
What do you see?
20 feet, if it's an inch...
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Ever see one like this?
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
I'll drink to your leg.
And I'll drink to yours.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
I think I can top that, Mister...
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
The shaft is giving.
Coming right to us!
He's heading under -- !
Follow him!
He's under!
What can that gun of yours do?
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
I don't have it.
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
No.
You lose!
I suppose anything's possible.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Hi, I'm Adele.
Carrie.
...I said, I like your hair.
...Thank you.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
What?
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
That French ain't it?
Are you takin' the pictures?
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
...Yeah, sure.
You dropped this.
So you don't do any of those things.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
How'd you meet Early?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
You can?
I'm cool.
Could I try that?
What's this?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Sure.
You took this picture?
Took 'em all.
That's me.
No it is not!
Hold still.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Do what?
Adele... are you serious?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
What's Early been in jail for?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Jeez... Adele!
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
...That's not true.
What?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Happy birthday Adele.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Almost.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
What'll we do out there?
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
I heard that.
What if they're dangerous?
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
As many times as it takes.
Shush, Adele.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Early, sing me a song.
Early, what're you doin'?
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
What the hell is this stuff?
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Yeah but, what is it?
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
...thank you.
...I don't know.
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
What's wrong with her?
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Early! Stop!!
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
What's your name, boy?
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
I don't know. Wish I did.
Where you from Walter?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
Tight fit.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Brian.
So what do you do Early?
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
...Too bad.
Can't hurt.
How much do I owe you?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Who?
Henry Lucas.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
That bad?
...Then some.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Dahlia, no.
Now why is that?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
That your... theory, ain't that what they call it?
Yeah.
Sure.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Damn right I do.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
...Ha.
Hell it don't...  ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.
So tell me... what happened here?
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
You two been busy in here.
What happened to Adele?
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Thank god!
A... I gotta go.
The party?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
...I do.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
...just like that?
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
Thanks. What are you doing?
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
...and I think I know why.
Why?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
A book on the warehouse murders?
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
What did he sound like on the phone?
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
I like that.
I still think we should have met them first.
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta Deliverance.  Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!
Funny, very funny.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Lighten up...
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Up yours.
I heard that.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Carrie.
I don't want to talk about it.
All set?
Fuck!
Who said he's my good buddy?
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
How do you know that?
She told me...  ...but only when she deserves it. Did you know he was in jail?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
What is it?
What's that?
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
There's more...
I'm finished.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Brian I want him out of our car!
Why, what did he do?
Carrie... stop it.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Then try again,
Carrie, watch for Early.
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
Bri'.
Where's Adele?
She wasn't feeling so good.
No, thanks, I can manage.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...Brian hurt his foot.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
No, never. Excuse me.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Siesta.
Early, just think...
Shut your mouth.
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Everybody just shut up!
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
...You're hurting me...
You were plenty hot.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
Wasn't my fault...
What is it?
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
By yourself?
Yes.
We seem to have a little problem here?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
What are you saying?
Casual.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
You are!  I don't like you.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
No.
What do you mean, no?
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
Morpheus.
What?
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. Her God has gone and left his home.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
No it wasn't.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
What do you want?
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
No.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
You got it on the board.
No, I need the original note.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
He's not talking about himself.
Then what's he talking about?
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
Then let's narrow it down.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
I'm positive.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
Yes you are.
Get off me!
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
What?
The message!  I figured out--
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
Local?
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
What do you think?
You think he's dirty?
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
No shit!
Sorry.
Anything?
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
You still having a problem with this?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
Maybe he's going to drug her?
How is she?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Sanderson?
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
It's a voice modulator.
Ready for round two?
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Why does he call Sanderson?
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
A few people.
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
What was suspicious about him?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
But a hundred men could move him.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
He was with me?
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
We'll find the evidence.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Who is this?
I haven't got time for this.
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Did you know her?
And -- what path is that?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Why not?
What?
Where is she?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
You're not going to tell me that.
Hello?
You know her?
But you said you didn't know her.
I'm just trying to play the game.
Then call them!
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
How?
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
You like to brag, don't you?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
Hello.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
They think that you and I are doing this together.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
You sonofabitch!
Let me speak to my daughter.
Please... wait.
It's me you want.  Not her.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  His play is always fair and just.
No!  Wait!!
The pipes.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Thanks.
What's this?
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Set up some pieces on the big board?
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
What is it?
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
What scars?
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Fuck off!
Feeling better?
I just can't believe it.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
He already did once.
Why did he?
Why did he what?
Come here.
He was watching you.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You're losing me.
You must be Erica.
I'm Kathy.
Is your dad here?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Nice meeting you.
My cheering section.
What are you doing up?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Who told you that?
Has he gotten through to any?
Nothing.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
For what?
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
It isn't Kathy.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
How long has she been dead?
Any sign of rape?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
Anything?
What about prints?
You mean, no prints but hers?
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
That's great.
Same as the others?
Well?
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
We're not sure.
What do you think he did?
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
It's important.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
And this Jeremy--
--Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
What about the way he arranged the body?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Anything else?
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
Meaning?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
This ain't no photo.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
What did he mean by Huxley?
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
He moves around a lot.  Why?
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
That's a big area to cover.
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
What time did he get there?
About a quarter to one.
He's right, Kathy.
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
We're going to work on the message.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
The most logical choice.
You don't have a shred of evidence!
Did you see his face?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
I got it from the tournament directory.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street.  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
That's it?
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
Another one?  What word did he leave?
Is.  Did you tell him about the institute?
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
It doesn't make sense.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Maybe I already have.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
A building?
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
He uses castles...plural --  then says can't move me.  Singular.  Not can't move us.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Where were you last night?
Are we going to go through this again?
I went out.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
Did you send the car?
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
Then I'll transpose.
I suppose you have something in mind?
It's a good play, but risky.
We got a problem?
Is it serious?
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
I want to be the best I can.
You have something you want to say?
About what?
Who says something's on my mind.
No.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
What are they, please?
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
It's alright.
Is this your first time here?
Yes.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
How come you don't stay with them?
No.  I don't.
Are you with the tournament?
Are you one of the players?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
When I was very young.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Sounds very violent.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
That's a very personal question.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
Do you always open quickly?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
You.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
Well, I think I've had enough.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
No you didn't.
They couldn't break the riddle.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
We need your help.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
She could be dead after the game.
She could be dead now.
What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
You sure you don't want to eat something?
I don't think I could.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
You sound like my mother.
It wasn't intentional.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
I think it's interesting.
Another kind of game?
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Do you?
Let's change the subject.
Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?
I'm just curious.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
You mean like in the steam room?
That's not fair!
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
You have to win every point, don't you?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Of course.
Because I work with them.
No.
You're not?
Relax.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I know it was bad.
I know you didn't
Doesn't that scare you?
Why?
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I'm sure you are.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
No.  You were talking about chess.
Alright.  What about me?
She died in a car accident.
I'm sorry.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
It was.
And you?
What?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
I'm not playing a game now.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What?  By attacking me?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
Does anyone?
Then show me who you are.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
No.
I'm hungry.
Call room service.
Fine.
You.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.
Did you call?
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
Peter, you have to admit--
Peter...
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
For emphasis?
Exactly.  It's the key.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
What?
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Right.  Here!  c-4.
Hi.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
You really haven't seen my best side.
Peter...
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
You don't understand.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
It's not that easy.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
Because she killed herself!!
Why not?
Because I know what it says.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
It could be anything.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
How did you know it was carefully?
Frank told me.
No he didn't.
You're right.  The killer told me.
He didn't tell you either.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
You're going to be late for your match.
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
You beat him.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
It's over now.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
Do we have a future?
I'm sure you are.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
...Office 2702.
No?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
No.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Yeah.
...Not at all.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
No, no.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Why can't I have a bank account?
Well, I don't need them...
OK, I'm fine.
Good.
Huh... 500 meters?
How can you say it?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
What, for example?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Rocket launcher.
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Wow! It's brilliant!
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Who'll I aim at?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Perfect.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
OK.
Now, try a running guy.
OK.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
Yes, yes...
What?
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
OK.
Come on, get down!
You were scared, weren't you?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
...Because I feel it.
Mathilda? May I come in?
Yes.
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
Quick doesn't mean ready. And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
May I go to the cinema?
No.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
No, you can't go out.
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Not taken.
Why?
Too heavy.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
I never rent my gear.
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
Mathilda, stop, please!
Stop. Everyone is looking.
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
When I say I love you.
Mathilda?!
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...17.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
What shall we do?
Where are you going?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
...Why didn't he close the window?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
There are better things.  You see the importance of the moment.  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...Later.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
I like my horizons narrow.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
A little...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
It's too big.
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
I love you so much, Leon.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
...Don't you drink?
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
You okay?
...No...
...Don't you like me?
How many girlfriends did you have?
...I don't know.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Three times, then two times.
May I ask you a personal question?
...Yes.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Nothing, for the moment.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Yeah, what?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Mathilda, listen!
No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
You say it just to calm me!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...I got lost, Mister.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
I have no fear.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...Composer.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
...No... he's my lover...
Huh? Why?
...And how much is it?
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
You don't have squat.
Lay off, asshole.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Let's talk Hubley.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Nice signal, dickwad!
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
What's this?  What's going on?
Nothing?
Get the picture?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
How the hell do you know that?
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Did you learn anything?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why'd I do what?
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Who said that?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
I'll handle it.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Tell me.
That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Stay back!  I'm okay.
You know that guy?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Yeah... I know the routine.
Was.  Divorced.
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
... and so, and so the doctor says, If this is the thermometer
Your health...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Where'd you get this?!!
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
How potent?
We?  You've taken it?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
Uh, George...
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
Shit!
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
What is this?!
Harcourt is dead.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But there's no more drug.
What is it?
Only holds five.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Who else can I ask around here?
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
That where Anderson worked?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
What's that?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
The human?
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Yeah.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Yeah, I'll bet.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
What kind of test?
Did he find anything?
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Departmental policy.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Hope their plumbing's the same.
What?
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
You got your vest?
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Get outta there!
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Yes.  That follows.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Could it be intelligent?
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
How long until it blows?
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
I'll go.
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
See you soon.
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Ripley...
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
You did okay, Bishop.
Well, thanks, I --
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Is she...?
Amy.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
I get the picture.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
I don't think so.
Sheila'll be at Tops.
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, V?
No.  There's no way!
Hear me out...
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
No, I'm okay.
They're comin' with us.
What?
Yeah.
I'm, okay... You okay?
This is our bedroom.
Yes, I thought my wife...
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
No. Fred hates them.
No.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
That's right.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
If I go.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
I was here yesterday.
Yeah, I remember.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I don't know.
I want more.
Me, too.
Can I call you?
Okay, baby.
It's me...
Hi.
I can't see you tonight.
Okay...
Sure.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
Hello.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
He'll kill us.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
We should stop seeing each other.
No... no.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Have you partied with him?
I used to.
You like it?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
Pornos.
Yeah.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Pete... Don't...
In pornos?
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
You liked it.
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
Andy?
Yeah. Call him.
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Okay...
Okay.
Set.
Why are ya goin' so early?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Oh, yeah?... What else?
Are you my man?
Yes.
You got him.
Alice, I...
You all right?
We killed him.
Alice?
Alice...
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
That's the plan.  My word on it.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Alice?
Andy, who is that guy?
I don't. I don't know him.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sure.
Better.
What night is that?
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
What's up?
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Yeah? what did they want?
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Sheila?
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
Did you tell the police this?
What happened to me?
Please tell me.
I hope you're right.  I really do.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
No... I don't. Why?
That the atmosphere processor?
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Nothin'.
Who was the man?
Who is it?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
FUCKIN' A.
That's it.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
She's right.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
The first night... Not the last two.
My... My head.
No, no. I want to go in.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
That's absurd.
Where's Alice?
What are you going to do?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
Wake me up when you get home.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Why not?
What's that?
A videotape.
Who's it from?
Does it say anything on the tape?
No, nothing.
It must be from a real estate agent.
Good book, huh?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Same one you were reading the other night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I called, you know.
Called? When?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
I had a dream about you last night...
Yeah?
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
You're up early.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Who the hell owns that dog?
Don't you want to watch it?
I guess so.
We've got to call the police.
All right.
So?
Two detectives are coming out.
We will.
Thanks, guys.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Bullshit!
What the hell is going on?!
I wish I knew.
What was that?!!!
What?
Where would you feel safe?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
I thought you were getting me a drink?
Just a minute.
Let's go home.
But...
Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
He's got some fucked up friends.
I told you to stay in the car!
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
You son of a bitch.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Corporal Hicks!?
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
Give that a try.
All right!
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
I can see that.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
At sixty?
What'd I tell ya.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the Caddy by tomorrow.
You like pornos?
Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Suit yourself, champ.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
You will.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
It'll be ready.
You're my man, Pete.
How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Now, wait a second --
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Who is this?
You know who it is.
Mr. Eddy?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
Yeah.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
No. No, I don't.
What?
Yeah.
What are you guys doin'?
Guess we're goin' over to the Ten Pin.
You want some company?
Sure.
Why haven't you called me?
Sorry... I...
What night?
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean?
You were acting like a different person.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Sure. Sure I do.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
No... I told you.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Sheila?!
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
What do you want?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I don't know.
Come on... get in.
Why don't you like me?
I do like you, Sheila.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
I was?
Yeah.
I didn't know you cared.
Come on.
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Sheila...
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Hey... Sheila.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Go home, Sheila.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
Still nothing from the colony?
It's insured.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
One of us?
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
I don't know.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
They're but off!  Do something!
How do you feel?
Forget it.
Save it.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Are you finished?  You okay?
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Let's get these things lit.
Wally!
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Is it now?
What?
Is it now?
What?
They're inside.
Who?
Take it.
Agatha...
Agatha --
What?
Drop some money.
Forget that guy --
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Well you're not reading it right!
No.  Follow him.
He'll turn around.
He won't.
Agatha...
Wait.
He's here.
I can't.  I have to know.
Please --
Oh, God...
What is it?
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Anderton --
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
Where are we going?
Someplace safe.
I have to go back.
Why?
The other two will die without me.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
Who wanted her little girl back?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
She grew up.
She's still alive?
Fuckin' A!
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
Oh, Jesus...
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
What --
RUN!
-- but he didn't.
Then who was he?
Just some guy... they found.
Found?  Where?
Somewhere.
Because I found out about her...
About who?
Anne Lively...
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
I know... I do, too...
John?  What is it?
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
That's comforting.
Right.  I know --
Yeah --
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
It's all I could safely move.
We know each other?
Poor bastard.
From where?  D.C.?
I put you away --
You made those tapes...
You set your patients on fire!
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
I can't even stand up --
Go blind.  I know.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Drowning.
Victim's a white female.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
You the only sentry?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Try again.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Lara --
Tell me not to worry, John.
The nation votes this week...
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Uh-huh...
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Hang on, Lamar --
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
I understand.  Sir.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
Yes, sir.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
Lara called me.
What?
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I'm fine.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
In the middle of the night?
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
We won't let them.
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
And who the hell is that?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Can you fake the cerebral output?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
You can't run --
Everybody runs.
John --
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
They're in the approach corridor.
On my way.
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
No doubt.
Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
Seventeen minutes.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
You're kidding, that's today?
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
Uh, sir...
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
What he's doing now, we call scrubbing the image, looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
I show a cop on horseback.
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
Everybody runs.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Now many?
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Somewhere near the capital?
No maglev system.
The mall?
Georgetown.
Yeah?  So?
Now look at him...
Did he close the front door?
What?
Did Marks close the front door?!
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Go back to work.  All of you.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
We're in motion on something.
Red Ball?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Confirm with trig and image.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Take your time.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
You mind if I tag along?
Yes, it is.
Why did you catch that?
Because it was going to fall.
You're certain?
Yes.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
To Hineman?
To them.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the temple.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Flaws.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
They'll get us.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
You gonna tell on me?
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
She spoke to me.
She said...
Wally, listen to me...
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Are these all of her previsions?
What's this?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
I need your help.
I need help with her.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
So now I need you to hack into her.
They don't belong to anybody.
Stop --
What happened?  Where's the rest?
I scored a goal!
That's great.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
I won!
What a big boy.  How old are you?
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
Okay... now let me time you.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Come on!
All right, I'll try...
Sean -- you're not real.
You gotta have faith, Dad.
It's a little late for that.
What the hell.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
You're alive?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Oh, Sean --
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Sean --
I forgive you.
Once I even told him I loved him.
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I was looking for you...
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
I wanted to.
Good-bye, Dad...
Who are you?
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Sean, wait...
Hold your breath, Dad...
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
Some -- somebody's father?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
He's alive?
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
NO!
You're not gonna kill me?
No.
But you have to.  They said you would.
The precogs were wrong.
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
Who said I would?
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
What the fuck is going on?
What about the picture --
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
Let go of the gun.
Good-bye, Crow.
I'm a little dizzy...
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
The what?
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
And how would I know that?
What's so funny?
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You don't seem all that proud.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Heal who?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You're talking about the precogs...
And how did Lamar become involved?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
You say some of the children died?
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
So you won't help me?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Why?
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
I believe in that system...
You want to bring it down.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Hold that thought.
Why should I trust you?
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
You said they're destroyed.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
The safest place of all.
Where?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
If... you have one.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
You're insane or you think I am.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
How do I even know which one has it?
Which one is that?
John?
Oh, God, what did you do?
Then how did he --
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
This is all my fault.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
It's insanity around here.
I thought you were retiring?
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
Who?
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
I don't know who that is.
We know why John was tagged.
He also said Crow was a fake.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Sean --
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
I understand.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Lamar --
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Tell him not now.
Not.  Now.
I'll be right there.
Locked.
My God...
How did you get this?
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
He's my subordinate!
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Lamar, I found something.
What?
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
Where are you?
Good God.  What was that?
Wait, just a second...
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
It's the same prevision.
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
I don't understand --
This murder is happening at two different times.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
How?
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
Precog Deja Vu...
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Yes.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
What?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
Can't they shut that off?
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
We ain't going anywhere.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
What?!
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
Yes, I know.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
They're everywhere.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
Because he thinks he's innocent.
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
Two?
We can stop him.
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
No.  He can't...
There a maid in this hotel?
I don't know, why?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
What kind of cop were you before this?
Ellen.
Don't be long, Ellen.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an orgy of evidence.  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
None.  This was arranged.
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Knott!
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
John Anderton was my friend!
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
I know who you are.
This your work?
Yes.
I like it.
Cream and sugar.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
We used to, every summer.
He's not here now, is he?
I don't have any sugar either.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
No.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
That was our apartment.
Since right after we lost our son.
You mean after he lost your son.
It was nobody's fault.
But John was with him at the pool?
Yes.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
You know I need to use you.
To what?  Trap him?
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Tell me how all this works.
What does he want with a precog?
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Jesus...
What are you talking about?
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Yeah.
No thank you.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
What's 'incidentals?'
Is it a good room?
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Is it the good room?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
What if I gave you forty?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Where's the place to go tonight?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
See you later.
So you're models?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
Bullshit.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
She's, uh, sleeping.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
What's wrong, baby?
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Chloe?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
What time is it there?
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Honey?
Where were you?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Oh my god. What happened?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Who's watching the baby?
I'm ready.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
You talk to Max today?
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
I feel weird asking him.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Yeah? You sure?
Go.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Ho's a good guy --
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
I want you to quit.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
I'll support you.
Max offered to stake me.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
I never promised you anything.
How could you let her see this?
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
What'd you say?
I want you to take her with you.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
I said no touching.
Get your hands off of her.
Your dance is over.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Well, you look it. You win?
Draw.
What's your record at?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Yeah, sure.
You driving her?
Yeah.
She'll be out in a minute.
Get away from her.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
Yeah. Where is he?
He making the drop?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
What's his name?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
So, when's the drop.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
How bad is it?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
When's it going down?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Shit.
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Yeah.
So what do we do?
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Where is this happening?
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
No.
Brooklyn.
He must have that shit troughed.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Heard of them.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Where we going?
Quick drop. In and out.
How so?
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
That it?
That's it.
This is it.
Where's Ricky.
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
You like the ponies?
Sure. Yeah.
Me? No. Not really.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Why?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
This one?
Pshhh...
She was fast, huh?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
That's why they call it the smart money.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
I'll work it off.
What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
Then what are you saying?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I don't understand.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I know.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Yeah. Sorry.
Yeah.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Ruiz knows about this?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
He'll work it off.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Yeah. Sure.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
No. Okay. I'll think about it.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Yeah.
Yes.
What is it?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
There won't be a next thing.
Take a few days --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Good morning.
Nah, man...
A bad heart.
Where's the drop?
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
Bobby.
What's that?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
No. Just the cross streets.
No. That's cool, man.
Yeah.
'Trustafarians?'
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Taken care of?
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
It's important.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
We're with Ruiz.
Can you check?
Thanks.
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
What about boxing?
What about it?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
So?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it's not a winning record.
It's not losing record.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Don't be shitty.
How am I being shitty?
Don't be shitty.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I got no idea.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I will.
I'll page you with the number.
Bye.
I thought you hate that club.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
Fuck them.
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
He implied it.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Bullshit...
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
I'll beat your ass --
Sorry coach.
Sorry coach.
We look good this year.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Fuck him.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I like it.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Nice work.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
How'd you unlock my phone?
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Seat belt.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
What? Did she say something?
Who's driving her?
I don't know.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Right here's fine.
Is that the woman from..?
She really liked the kitchen.
It's ours.
To keep?
Pretty nice.
What's the movie?
I'll get the girl.
Nah, don't bother --
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
No. Look. There.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
You sure?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
C'mon, man...
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
How much is it?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
How much was it?
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Oh really. Why's that?
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Well, I don't want to walk.
Fuck...
What exactly did they say?
They didn't say an address?
I told you what they said.
Nothing else.
So they said more than the address.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
This is bullshit, man.
What the fuck do you...
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Motherfucker...
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
You got something to say --
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
I don't know.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
What did I 'get?'
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
So is this the drop?
Like I said, I don't know.
You would think.
Yeah.
So we're working?
You happy?
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You too?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Fuck this.
Back in.
You fucking nuts?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You got that right.
Fine.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
What the fuck was that about?
She was jonesing for me.
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
He wants to see us now.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
We're getting whacked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
Put that shit out...
C'mon, man...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
You want us strapped, don't you?
Let's do it.
I'm your soldier.
Let's check out the penguins.
The what?
The penguin house.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Did you hear what he just said?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
All the more reason.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
It was six in the fucking morning.
Float me a hundred bucks.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
You're out of money?
No.
What do you have left?
Eighty.
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
You did?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
What about it?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
Calm down.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
I'm sorry...
It's gonna be fine.
No more, man.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
So what do we do?
Let's just go now and wait.
Three and a half hours?
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Where do you get this shit?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
You're not getting a gun.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Easy...
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
Dude, we were practically made...
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
No. I'll wait here.
I'll be a minute.
Tom. How's it going?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
C'mon...
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
What do you mean 'kinda?'
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
You want your surprise?
Well, come on then. It's back here.
You want to come splash around.
I didn't do anything --
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Cardiff Giant?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
The videos.
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.
Where do you live?
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
Where's Spa.
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
How do you know it's not drugs?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
You strapped?
'Strapped?'
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
Don't drag my ass into this --
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
What? Why am I bad?
See you later.
Stop.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
Ow, shit...
Watch it...
I'm half Irish.
Just get back here!
And where is...?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
No?
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
No shit?
Does anyone want another?
You want another drink?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
What do you want?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Coke?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
No, really, mate?
Here...
Here they are, then.
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Come, now. You just got here.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Yeah.
Seal the door.
Good morning.
Nah, man...
Word.
Ricky.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you're our own private guy?
You know my pager number?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
A lot of Persians?
I call 'em wiggers.
Can I borrow a piece of --
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
We're going to New York?
Yes. You're going to New York.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
And where do we bring it?
Yeah.
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Keys.
What?
What about my keys?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Yes.
I get it.
Tell me.
So tell me how it is.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
Goodbye.
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
But, Max --
We're square.
Yes, sir.
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
No. I'll take a strega.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
She poured it for --
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
He has a cute what...?
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Who's gonna outfit us?
The Red Dragon.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Yeah.
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Edinburgh.
And where might that be?
Scotland.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
I am.
Dip?
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Who's up for a night on the town.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Terrible.
No.. I've slept enough.
What did you say?
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Casey.  She's my only friend.
I don't want you for a friend.
Why not?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
You're really something, ace.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
I'm sorry, Newt.
You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Why do they tell little kids that?
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Did you ever have a baby?
Where is she?
Gone.
You mean dead.
What am I doing here?
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
No.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
Am I a suspect?
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
What do you want?
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
I don't know shit about you.
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
So you are going to talk me to death.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
I'm not... easy.
Don't go!  Please.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[South America.]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
It's a little late.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
I'll call you tomorrow.
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Give me the address.
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
I show, you give me the information?
Where?
[Reina Rosas.]
[How do you contact 'the Boss'?]
[What is his name?]
[Daniel what?]
[Who pays you?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[Who's the boss?]
[What money?]
[So am I, Sister.]
I know, honey.  Me too.
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[Ordered by who?]
[Who ordered it?]
[I believe you.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[Who's he?]
Who's he?
[How do I recognize him.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[I want you.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
Burke!  Open the door!
Look!
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[What do you mean?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[And?]
[You stole the drop.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
Yes.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Come on.  Crawl faster.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Sure.  Go left.
It's loaded.
I drink.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
I'm here.
What do you mean, I'm here?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
So what's wrong?
Nothing wrong.
Don't give me that bullshit.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
How long you staying, Crease?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
Newt, wait!
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
You mean a misfire?
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Creasy?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
I said the plan was right here.
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Pinta...
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Yes or no?
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
I knew you'd come.
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Different door. Not far from here.
If they like me.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Who's Emilio?
No.
I'm looking for potential.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Time will tell.
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
No.
No.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Mommy...Mommy?
Right here, baby.  Right here.
And don't start crying.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
What are you doing?
No.
Well, I let him go.
They'll be back in a week.
Where?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
Do you always sleep with him?
Did you sleep alright?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
In a week you should be fine.
Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.
Can we dream?
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Well, it's a sort of wife.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
You feel sorry for the husband?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
No, that was in Columbia.
Don't worry. You will.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
No.
I'm sorry.
I dropped her at home.
I know you're not.
Look, I told you...
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
Your father has business.
The blocks.
That's not a question.
Still not a question.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Then be trained.
Be a swimmer.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves. New Testament, Romans 13.
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
You've done much of this work before?
Never.
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
I'm fine.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Because...  I was already dead.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Planned what?
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
I don't believe you.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Then don't come.
Creasy... Wait.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
You should be sleeping, baby.
Good news. You're going back to school.
Why won't you check out LV-426?
What are you talking about. What people?
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
You do?
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Don't forget your towel.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
Our child's safety is at stake.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
How many colonists?
Sweet Jesus.
I think it's nice he's American.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
She likes him.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
He has to go, Samuel.
Creasy.
It's not.
He has to go.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
[A beautiful circle.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
He's not a cop killer.
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
So am I.
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
I already ate.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Two tourists who never went home.
You helped him get this job.
That's what friends do.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
I can take care of myself.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
What was she to Creasy then?
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
Hello, guys.
They're not usually graduate students.
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
You're my hero.
Deal.
Yeah, okay.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Who's controlling your mind?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
How can I help you with the particles?
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Is that where you're family lives?
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
You're gettin' the car.
Manual or automatic?
You got it.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
I have to go face to face.
What do you got on Korda?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
Yep.
Is that all?
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Satisfied?
It's all there.
Yeah.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
Sorry... Habit.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
You ever been in a hostage situation?
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
It rarely has to be done.
I've rarely shot anyone.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I know.
Try to remember that.
What's the point of this?
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
Recruited you from where?
National Marksman Competition.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
You'd never been out of New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
How did you like Toronto?
It was okay.
You caught me on an up day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for fast advancement.
Is there something wrong with that?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
We could fill it with water.
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
Not the ones I'm at.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
You got a girlfriend?
Why? You like my ass?
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
I don't gamble.
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
You living together?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Explain how that works.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Oh, city girl. Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
We see each other every couple of months.
Every couple of months, huh?
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Where did you hear that?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
Lesson two, Dead Eye... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
I think I can handle that one.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
You think you can learn, McCall?
I think so.
First things is, don't say, What's going on? Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you.  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
It'll come. Try again.
Tell me what you need.
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
I'm not good at lying.
Get good at it.
You know the ten commandments?
Yes.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
You tell me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Yes.
To save lives.
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
Okay, stop.
What did you see?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
Why did he do it?
Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
You know why I like the track?
You're a compulsive gambler?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
I do.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
Fine.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
Still needs work.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
The 6 horse is last.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?
To run late!
The 6 horse is still last.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
They need to run first and second?
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
The jockey!
COME ON, RUSSELL!
We won!
We won.
How much you wanna bet?
How long you been coming here?
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
Occasionally you lose.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
There's your answer. He's smart.
And doing a very good job of it.
He's got the girl.
What the fuck is going on.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
That it is.
How many have you lost?
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
So what do you want to do?
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Good question.
McCall, you all right?
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Stay put.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
I know how you feel, Ray.
Let me show you something, Ray.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
My name's Scott Roper.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
I worship you.
You worship yourself.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Greg.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Hey.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
I'm not drunk. Yet.
You heard.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Can I come in?
That a new picture?
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
I've proved that, didn't I?
What do you want from me?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
You think I didn't need you?
If you did, you never showed it.
Ronnie...
I wanted to get this out of the way.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
As a matter of fact, I do.
It's already started.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
Mmm, needs a little something.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Yeah that's it.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Scottie...
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
It's okay. We broke up.
Just now.
How's Paco doing?
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
You like this place?
It's very nice.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
Yeah?
...Let me just show you.
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
Korda escaped.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Scottie, Scottie...
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Stay here, don't move.
Scottie...
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Scottie?
I've been thinking.
Hmm?
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Yeah.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
Scott...
...the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
The hell I am!
Prude.
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
Stay up there, Girl...
SHIT!
Tell him to give me a raise.
He says, Thank you very much.  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Roper.
Depends. What's up?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Your concern is heartwarming.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
What do you think would be in order?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
And a car.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
Repoed this morning.
I'll provide you with transportation.
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
I want to be put on this case.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Who's running it?
Roper...
Who's running it!
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
What do we got?
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
Any verification on numbers.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself Joe. There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
What have you promised them?
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Yeah, they are but...
Come on!
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
What's he doing here?
Don't remind me.
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
All right, I'll do it.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Uh, yes..
Business.
San Diego.
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
I need your help.
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
Yes?
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
My security people are right next door.
I appreciate that.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
That's...a comfort to hear.
I have a problem.
Ah.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
I remember you...in the elevator.
That's right.
You were very nervous.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
How do you know that?
You shot her?
Who did?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
What?
And your husband works for somebody else.
What the hell are you saying?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
This? I've never even fired one.
Indeed.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
I would also like to apologize.
For what?
For not believing you.
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
Can we go now?
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
Same to you.
What?
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Yes.
Come with us, sir.
I'd like to know what...
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Daddy?
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
You wouldn't...
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
You're out of your mind.
What's your point?
I will do no such thing.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
This says invitation only.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
The gun...
What about the gun?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
You...
You get another chance in ten minutes.
Then I have time for a drink.
What would you do in my place?
Tell me why I miss him.
He's dead?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
Tell me why he's dead.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
I killed you.
You fucked up.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
How am I supposed to get away?
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
Come back.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
Again.
No, please...
One thirty. California Ballroom.
That's right. That gives you...
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
No.
I want'to talk to her.
Forget about it.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Don't you threaten me.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
No, that's,..that's fine
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
Are you sure?
But...
I think you better put that away.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
We have to hurry.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
We made it.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
How did you see us kiss?
Ready?
Let' s do it.
Lynn!
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
Over and out.
I know you do, honey.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
Will you promise me that?
All right. Kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
I have to do something.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
I said I have to do something.
Is within himself.
You got anything smaller?
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Keep it.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
I remember. The big tipper.
Please...
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
That's right.
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
What are you supposed to do?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Who?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Oh, Jesus ...
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Then why'd you drag me into it?
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Yeah, all right, listen...
So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
What are you going to do?
Keep the change.
Meet Irene.
Hi.
Irene is going to help.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You're going to go see her.
What!?
What am I supposed to say to her?
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
Well?
I don't know.
What are you going to do now?
What are you going to do!?
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
Thanks for the shine.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
I don't think so.
I think this is worth a dollar.
Gimme a dollar.
Yeah.
It's under control.
Help me get her off the rug.
Shut up.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
I'm looking for them.
Right there.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Foreigners! Fuck!
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
And what happens if I don't call you?
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
You're wasting time.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
That's enough.
Come Back.
Put her on.
Hm!
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
I'll bet.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Where's your Mom?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Listen to me John.
Here they come.
Dad, you're bleeding...
Yes, Dad.
You understand?
Not even her?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. I will guard Pearl with my life...
I will guard Pearl with my life...
...and I won't never tell about the money.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
I been mindin' Pearl.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
When'll the skiff be ready?
O, she's all right.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
No.
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Uncle Birdie!
So you ain't with the State no more?
Plan on a longer visit next time.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
How do you mean?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Walt!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Mother, I only --
What's wrong, Mother?
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
I'll be switched!...
Just went?
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Is he hit pretty bad?
All to pieces!
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Bluebeard!
Twenty-five wives!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
Tricked us!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Fiddlesticks!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
Pearl dotes on him.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
What?
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
It's a shame!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
Amen! Amen!
Mister Powell!
What could have possessed that girl!
Amen.
How?
What!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
There! What's so hard about that!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Blue men.
Hing, hang, hung.
You better not sing that song.
Why?
'Cause you're too little.
Tell me a story, John.
The Blue Men?
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
John...
Sshhh...
Now can I tell?
Hm?
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
You swore, Pearl!
John! Don't!
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
You what?
Pearl! You ain't --
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
It's all here.
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
She's gone to Moundsville.
To see Dad?
Someone is after us, Pearl.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Why?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Where are we goin', John?
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
I'm hungry, John.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
It'll spoil our supper.
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Hush.
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
That's Daddy!
Ssh...
Don't you hurt her!
She talks to herself.
Dead.
I mind you said there was two.
He ain't my Dad.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Is that all?
Huh?
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
No. No.
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Yes. Yes.
I don't know nothin'!
I'll tell.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Don't you believe me?
Yonder.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Mm-hm.
Yes?
Yes?
What secret shall I tell?
That's no secret. I'm five.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
All right.
John's bad.
I'm hungry.
Can I have my supper please?
Can I have milk too?
Because John said I mustn't.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
The first night?
How's that?
What do you figure to do?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
How'd you know I was here.
Who else'd be in your truck.
You heard it?
How's that?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
How many a those things you got now?
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
Didn't know there was any.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
'Predate it.
How fresh is this coffee?
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
In Angola. Yeah.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
Yes, you've circled round.
How come're you doin that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
Yes I do.
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
Most don't.
You're discouraged.
I'm... discouraged.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
No ID in her room?
No money in his room there?
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Yes.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Uh-huh.
Oh yes.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
You ain't heard from him?
No I ain't.
Nothin'?
Not word one.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
He can take all comers.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yes ma'am, I do.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
Carla Jean...
No.
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
It could be.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
...You ride Winston.
You sure?
Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything happens to Loretta's horse I can tell you right now you don't wanna be the party that was aboard.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
That's the boy.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
Mm.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
That's possible.
But you don't believe it.
No. Probably I don't.
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
We goin' in?
What about yours?
I'm hidin' behind you.
Believe you're right.
That from the lock?
So when was he here?
I don't know. Oh.
I'm ahead of you there.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
I don't know. He ought to...
What was the bullet?
Wasn't no bullet.
Wasn't no bullet?
No sir.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Well I don't either!
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
No sir.
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir. It was punched out.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
How's that, Sheriff?
Natural to the line of work they was in.
Yessir.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
...This month's checks.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
Hyah!
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
I always am.
I never do.
Well. If you say so.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
What do you think.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
I got it Mama.
I put it in, Mama.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
No.
I ain't got the money.
No.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...I need to sit down.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
No. But I gave my word.
You gave your word?
To your husband.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
Yes. Things fall into place.
It's full a money.
That'll be the day.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
At the gettin' place.
Did you buy that gun?
No. I found it.
What'd you give for that thing?
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
I need to know that.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Big talk.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
That'll work.
Llewelyn.
Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' where?
What're you goin' to do?
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Well -- how come?
So... for how long do we have to...
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Llewelyn --
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
You can't afford one?
Promise?
Yes I do.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Uh-huh.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
You should be used to that.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Llewelyn?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Llewelyn?
Hey.
What should I do?
You know what's goin' on?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What did you tell him?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
What makes you say that?
I can hear it in your voice.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
She'll be all right?
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
Why would I let you do that?
I know where the money is.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I know something better.
What's that.
I know where it's going to be.
And where is that.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I mean the nature of you.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Yes I did.
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
You expect him?
Step out of the car please, sir.
Screwgie.
All right...
How'd you find it?
You from around here?
What airport would you use.
Airport.
I don't know.
Who is this.
You know who it is.
...You need to talk to me.
I don't need to talk to you.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Why would I care where you're going.
Do you know where I'm going?
...I know where you are.
Yeah? Where am I?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah. I know where you're going.
All right.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
Yes.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
How much?
Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
I seen you was from Dallas.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Didn't mean nothin'.
I was just passin' the time.
I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
...Will there be somethin' else?
I don't know. Will there?
Is somethin' wrong?
With anything?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.
See about closing.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Generally around dark. At dark.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Sir?
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
...What time do you go to bed.
Sir?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Well...
I could come back then.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
You said that.
You live in that house behind the store?
You've lived here all your life?
You married into it.
You married into it.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
Sir?
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Call it.
Call it?
For what?
Just call it.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
I didn't put nothin' up.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
No.
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Everything.
How's that?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
All right. Heads then.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Sir?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
...Where you want me to put it?
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
Uh-huh.
Somethin' like that.
The kind with the most poles.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
One room, one night.
You on all night?
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
Good. I need everything else.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
It's all right.
I want you to take me to another motel.
November the 28th, last year.
No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
Yessir.
Okay.
Well enough.
What do you want to know?
Okay. We can stop that.
...I'm wondering...
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
The what?
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
Could I get another room.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
What about one forty-two.
No, one forty-two.
That's me.
Half.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Then you'll like me.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
How would you describe him?
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Sugar?
I know how he found me.
It's called a transponder.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not that way.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
No. You don't understand.
...What do you do?
What did you do?
Cast iron?
Yes.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
What product.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
I don't know. American citizens.
You do, I reckon.
I got an overcoat on.
No sir.
Yes sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
How is she?
Could I have that in American?
So she did witness it?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
...I meant your food.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
Sheriff, I don't...
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of church bake sales in perspective...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
You should get the order you want.
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
...plenty
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Oww! My arm, careful!
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
No, Elden, I need to...
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
Jesus...
You think a woman did that?!
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Bad idea...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Junior year!
Anyway, so what?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
You're lying!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
We think we know where Betty is.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Tell him what you told me.
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
I know that...
Well, do something, then, damnit!
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
No, I didn't have to.
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
That's a nice name for what you need...
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
What about it?
Any idea where it is?
Little place called Williams
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
I know plenty.
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
Banners?
No, I was just... How you doing?
They're fine... you miss it?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Who are these idiots?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Oh, this is wonderful...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
Do you know who I am?
...I... I know what you are.
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
...to see you.
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I am?
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Umm, I don't think that...
Thirty-two?
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
That's my son! My son is dead!
I'm sorry.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
I better go check on them.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
...what're you saying?
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Did you watch it yet?
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Oh, Betty --
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
No... what about your sister?
It's all right.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
What?
The LeSabre!
What?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Yeah, me too.
I gotta go make dinner.
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
Do what?
I gotta go.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
We were engaged.
You knew Del?!
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
You told me that two hours ago.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at Skies
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Of course.
I know. It's up to us.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Ad lib?
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Why are you doing this to me?
David, please --
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
I ran back in to get the phone.
What's so special about it?
What was that?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
Sure you don't want any salad?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
...like the water purifiers?
I got you, Del...
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
That is a skill!
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
I came for love...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I don't know.
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Make sure it's elevated...
Uh-huh.
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
What're you doing here, Roy?
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
It was Chloe...
Roy! What are you doing here?
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
It's not really a good time, guys...
What's the matter here?
I begged him to let me put that on!
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
So you're into Reason
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
I'd slap his face.
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
Where you headed, Betty?
Los Angeles, California.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday
Did you love it?
Sure I loved it! It was great.
That's horrible!
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
How did you know?
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
I'll go to the Hospital.
Worse.
You made out alright.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
She called you 'George,' George.
...did I win some contest?
What are you doing?
He has no heartbeat!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I came for love. My fiancÃš is here.
It's something I had to do. For David.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
Man, that is love.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
I got this apartment with a guy.
The one you were telling me about?
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
The Five?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
He has a wife?!
God, that's awful!
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  Please call if you have any information on David Ravell. This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
How many men have I talked to?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
I was talking about what you could wear!
Guess who I saw today.
Who?
Doctor David Ravell.
What? Where was he?!
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
HE IS REAL!!
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Fine.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
...okay.
What are those for?
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Umm...
Looking for someone?
You never know who you'll see.
Were you with him this whole time?
You still in love?
Does he know you think he's real?
He is real.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
No, almost never.
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
Are you sure I can borrow this?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Rosa...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
You should have a little faith in people.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
All the time. It's always Loma Vista this, Loma Vista that.
Rosa, so you've met David?
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
No, that should be more than --
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
Ahh... my wife's.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
Fine. You got five...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
Could you give us an example?
Of what?
I don't follow...
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
No...
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Hmmmm. Five Stars
You did not just say Injuns
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
My socks?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
...and put them in your mouth.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Beer, please.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
That's right.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Now, that's really stupid.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Hell of a way to die.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
A mark, huh?
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
IT SURE IS!!
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
You told me how to do it!
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
He told us it's in the Buick.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
...that's a good motto.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
We can live with that.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Should I kill him now?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Joyce was screwing Del.
...among others.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Like... us?
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
You're always so coarse... Do her right here. Let's just see what happens, okay?  I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother'
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
Half.
What?
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That make a statement
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
Worse... you're in Texas.
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
What the hell's the matter with you?
That was a really shitty thing to do.
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
How'd they describe her?
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
We should go.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
No.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral...  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.
What?
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
It's beneath her... She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
A doctor on the show... why?
It just didn't fit her profile...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
I said 'got it?'
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
You made your point...  I was wrong.
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
What's wrong with you?
Very graceful. Perfect form.
What do you mean?
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
...and how long did she work here?
Hmm... you two in high school together?
But she wanted more out of life, right?
I see.  May I?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
Isn't that the point?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
Seems like a nice place.
It is, if you like idiots...
Really?
You better believe it.
Jesus Christ!
He's waiting...
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Injuns?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, Betty?
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
We know that...
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
Is there a problem, George?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
I SAID FORGET IT!
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Yeah? The sport utility?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Oh fuck...
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
Would you say she was ambitious?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Did Chloe crack?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
She's a lesbian.
You lie, motherfucker...
I swear to God!
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Her show?
A Reason to Love.
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
Yeah?
Mr. Campbell?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
What?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
Not with me.  Not with people.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
You're welcome.
Peace out.
What if she called the cops?
What the fuck is funny about this?
God.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
He said open it.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
You should see the look on your face.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
Me.  I am.
That's right.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
I have the gun.
Remember that.
Please...
What?  What do you want me to do?
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
I can't...
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
This is ridiculous...
Th --
Okay, okay!  Okay.
You got an idea?
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
The hell does she want?
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
She's gonna handle it.
That's your problem.
That's their problem.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
You finish.  Then we finish.
posed to mean?
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Get the fuck away from me.
Bullshit.
You know how this gotta end.
The walls are steel, right?
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Fuck.
I know.
Fuck!
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
You're an idiot.
Who is this guy?
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
They won't get hurt.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
Asshole.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
The fuck did you bring a gun for?
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Pure idiot.
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
Shut up.
Shut up and let me think.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
She said she did.
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
Open it.
I did.
Be quiet.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
They're coughing.
They're gonna die in there!
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Cell phone.
Shit!
She's never coming out.
Hey.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
What about us?
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
Adios.
Yeah?
Huh?
I don't get it.
Somebody called you?
What do you want?
No, you can't come in.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Oh, that phone call...
Huh?
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
A what?
Open it.
I said open the door.
Watch your mouth.
It's okay, Raoul.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
It's just the woman and the kid?
Cut it back a little bit.
No fucking way.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
Half?  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say you or Raoul, got it?
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Suit yourself.
Nobody leaves.
Observe.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
Something's weird.
Makes me nervous.
Ever read any Poe?
What's to keep them from prying open the door?
Open the door.
Too many stairs.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.
Well, I know that now.
478-0150.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
The crowd goes wild.
478...
150
Fuck him.
Don't.
Fuck her too.
What's going on?!
People.  In the house.
That room!
What?!
Damn it!
It doesn't work?!
Can't hear a thing.
What do they want?
What do we do?
Wait.
What if they get in here?
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
I heard you.
Feel okay?
Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
Huh uh.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house.
Fuck.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Are you freaking out?
Little bit.  Yeah.
Small space?
Don't though.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I don't know, why?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
I am.  I'm here.
YOU HAVE TO!
I'm here.  I'm here.
What, what, what is it?!
Morse code?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Titanic.
Got him!
Come on, come on...
Shhh...
Do it.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
No.
Close it!
What are you doing?
I saw something, I saw...
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
Blue is phones?
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
On it!
He'll do something.
Uh uh.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said There are three...
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
He --
He WILL.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Why?
I was trying not to tell you...
What?
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Huh uh.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
What if I keep dropping?
Not an option.
What if I do?
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
Where is the Glucogen?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Okay.
Who might you be, little Miss?
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Bite?
Ayuh.
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Well...I guess not.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Yes--
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Is that right, dad?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
It's gorgeous!
Yes, but the rope might be--
Honey, Church will be fine.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Of course I will.
Please hurry.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Yes.
Yaay!
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
No-I guess not.
Yayyy!
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Well, I thought it was safe--
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
For a little while.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
To remember.
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Is he really all right?
Yes.
Because you promised.
I know.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
I hate that smell.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
That's enough, Ellen.
Ellie? What's wrong?
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Huh?
What's up, sugar?
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Do you believe that?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
You believe in it.
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
I don't get it.
Yeah, sure.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
I'm sure you're not.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Ellie--
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
Do you swear?
I swear.
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Was it Pascow?
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Hey--they actually found the place!
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
You need a glass?
Not at all.
Good for you.
God, that's fine.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
What were you listening to?
Allman Brothers.
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
What's at the end of it?
You folks ready to go on?
Sure.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
Not yet...how much further is it?
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
I think it is so, Ellie.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
It's Church.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
I don't know.
No need to apologize.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
But--
Does she love the cat?
Yes, but--
Then come on.
What say, Louis?
We're still not where we're going.
What do you mean?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
I'm not climbing that.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
You'll see before long. Let's go.
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
Ayuh.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
You're telling me.
Almost there, Louis.
You keep saying that.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
Whose burying ground?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Why? For God's sake, why?
I guess so...but...
You want to rest a bit before you start?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
What are those for?
Your cairn.
Doesn't look like they last long.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Because it's right.
But--
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
What did we do, Jud?
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Wouldn't wash?
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
Can I have another one?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Wendigo?
Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you...
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Yes.
Why, then, things should be fine.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
Rachel not feeling well?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
This babe has said enough.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- God sees the truth
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
It's Ellie's cat.
Nope. He's your cat now.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Louis--
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
And because the dead walked.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
Leave me alone!
You don't understand--
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
Let her go. It's cool.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Gage's gone!
Jesus, the road!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
The movers--
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Did you see his shirt?
My God!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
She's finally asleep.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
I just said--
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
And Church will be fine.
Well, honey...you know that...
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Getting there.
Good d--
I heard you tonight.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
That's forgotten.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Yes, I guess I do.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Louis, are you sure?
I'm sure.
Oh. When are they expected home?
He has it. Thank you.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Namely?
Like disposing of their wives?
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
For instance?
His wife took a trip.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
All right -- you don't believe me.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
Thanks.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Do that.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
I was jaywalking.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
I think they missed their chance with her.
She never left the apartment --
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
What time?
Six ayem.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Feel a little foolish?
Who said they left then?
Who left -- where?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, Grand Central Or Bust!?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
Jeff -- huh?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
I can't do that.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase search warrant issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
I can hear myself starting out. Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: Your request for transfer turned down --
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Mrs. Thorwald.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
Jewelry?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
You sure it belongs to his wife?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
You figured that out, huh?
Did you ever own a saw?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
But I'm not a killer!
Your logic is backward.
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
All the things I hate.
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
That depends on who they were.
The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Jefferies.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Your Lisa?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I told you that --
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
A possibility.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
You think perhaps it was old hambone?
Where'd they take Lisa?
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Jefferies.
For what?
Who said I was getting rid of it?
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Next time, have some good news.
Gunnison?
It's me.
The word is everything. Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
No.
I can't. The police have it by now.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
Well, I only quote from the best.
I predicted it.
How?
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
It crashed, didn't it?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
I knew it!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
She expects me to marry her.
That's normal.
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.
I'm not ready for marriage.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
She's all right.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
No.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
Stella!
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
She's just not the girl for me.
She's only perfect.
Is what you want something you can discuss?
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
You're never going to marry?
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
I can just hear you now. Get out of here you perfect
That's the hard part.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
We've progressed emotionally in --
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
She pay you much?
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
I was.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Depends one which one.
Keep your mind off her.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
And some man will lose his.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
He and his wife splitting up?
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
What about this morning? Any developments?
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
In this heat?  They're up now.
A Federal offense.
Get back there! He'll see you!
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Uh-huh.
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Police?
Huh?
You called the police?
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
Mrs. Thorwald?
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
There's something buried there.
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
Look!
Thank heaven that's over!
I have a feeling we've just begun.
I wonder.
What?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
You can tell that from here?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
Would four of them -- ?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
What are you two talking about?
Got a shovel?
No.
There's probably one in the basement.
Now wait a minute --
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
What do you need money for?
To bail Lisa out of jail.
One hundred and twenty-seven.
How much do you think you'll need?
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Ten here.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
What about the rest?
Mrs. Doyle?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
You haven't even heard from him?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
How's your leg?
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?
Empty as a football.
And you love life?
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
Uh-huh.
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Only because it's expected of her.
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
a steal at eleven hundred dollars.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
Something big going on somewhere?
Going on right here. It's a big night.
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Big enough?
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
What a day I've had!
Tired?
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
That's good news.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Make the one you want.
Yes.
For what?
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
That's what is know as manless melancholia.
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
How can you tell that -- from here?
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
I think it's enchanting.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Lisa! Shut up!
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Of course not.
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
Without any future?
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Don't you ever have any problems?
I have one now.
So do I.
Tell me about it.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Homework. It's more interesting.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
What do you think?
Something too frightful to utter.
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
Now, Lisa --
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
What is it you're looking for?
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
Maybe she died.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
Lisa, please!
There's nothing to see.
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
What are you getting at?
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
Yeah.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
No comment.
Don't you see how silly you're being?
Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
125 West Ninth Street.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
To get on home.
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
What about it?
Someone not his wife?
I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
I wonder where he's going now?
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
Thinking about Thorwald?
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?
Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Inside stuff?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
That's what the witnesses told him.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
We have all -- what?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
I have the whole weekend off.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
Staying the night here, uninvited.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
I hate funny exit lines.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Huh?
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Whatever happened to that old saying Love Thy Neighbor.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Thank you.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
But you're not?
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Is he cleaning house?
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Well?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Wasn't that close?
Too close.
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
What for?
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
How?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word we a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Shut up. I'm all right.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
L. B. Jefferies.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Gabriel -- !
Must have a way with stationery.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
Gabriel, let him go --
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Gabriel!
A man of some travels.
Is this him!?
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Please, Gabriel, don't...
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
YES!!!
Gabriel, you promised!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
NO!
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
We're talking, aren't we?
No, baby. He wants me.
He wants... your sister...
...whoever she is.
To all those cons...
Searching for a money man...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
-- till he fucked his parole --
plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
I've been doing good, though.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
He'll be dead when he does.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Thank you.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
I don't think it's negative five.
Radio said.
No, no --
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Saw me --
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
You are to me.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
What.
Smile.
No --
One more. Smile. One more.
No, c'mon --
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Tell me again.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Where the hell are you going?
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Ashley, Jesus --
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
You need a COAT!
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
You forget where I work?
Beauty and fragrances.
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
Well, I don't know about that --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
We could live it up and --
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
I'll see what I can do.
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
NO!
NICK!
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
Nick...
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
Your brother...
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
What the fuck is going on.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
What's going ON!!!
You motherfucker.
Nick, no --
You sold him out.
Nick --
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Nick, what are you --
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
Nick, I love you --
JESUS CHRIST!
Get the hell off of me!
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
He'll kill you.
You're not hearing me here --
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
Nick, please, it's me --
No, Nick, no --
You're in on this.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
Nick died for me....
...maybe I die for Nick...
Canada.
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
Jack. Jack Bangs.
Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said when your boyfriend gets out
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
I thought we'd have a few more days.
For what? You to talk me into helping? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
No!
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
Not without you.
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
He working for them on this one?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
What?
They're truck drivers.
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Get your own room, Ashley.
Nick...
Get your own room.
That guy knows you?
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
Nick, what happened --
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
Nick, the ice is --
Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
You saved me.
I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
They'll have guns.
What?
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
I don't know...
We'll need one.
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
Nick, what are you talking about?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
Part of... with them?
He wants to see your map.
He says he wants it now.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
No.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
They all are. Football's on.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Well. I'm going home.
Yeah. That's love.
You... you... YOU --
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
I saved your life.
You shouldn't have.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
Who wouldn't.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
I'm glad it was me.
Merry Christmas.
What?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
What are you talking about?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
No --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
But I never said Rudy.
You said it a million times!
I never told you my name.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
The hell I can't.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Put him in the truck.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
You're not Nick Mason...
I shared his cell!
But you were saying you were...
So you could get with my sister.
Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.
Yes!
And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
She says a lot of things.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Wish I had a brother like you.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
I had better sex in prison.
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
Where's she work?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her middle name?
What'd they call her in high school?
Bam Bam.
What'd they call her in college?
What college.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
Be more specific.
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
No. It's her brother.
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
You knew the place --
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
I don't know.
Five million?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
Hey, it's... been two years --
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
Hell. Ten?
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
What?
I said, who the hell made the map?
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
We walked the place for a week.
And I worked there. For a year.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
So what the hell good are you...
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
They won't recognize me.
Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
More than you know.
Rather be back in the Mountain?
Might as well be.
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Put it on.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
You do.
At least gimme video poker.
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Get out.
You got one hour.
I'm gonna need some money.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
Don't tip.
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
...never... tried...
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
Got something to say to me, Nick?
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
Nnn... nothing...
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
NO!
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
No, Gabriel... no...
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
Start singing.
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
Sing it in pictures, Nick.
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
You need six.
No.
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
Six men means six guns.
No way.
I'm no threat without a gun.
No, you're not.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
No gun.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
You gotta be kidding me.
'Tis the season, convict.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Get in the CAR!
How'd you know my name...
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
How'd you know my name.
Take 'em.
Leave the tree.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Where the HELL did he go?
Show's over.
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
Where is he?! Where is he?!
OPEN IT!!!
GO!!!
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
What?
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
Merlin, I didn't know --
I promise you, I didn't know!
It's a roach, guy --
Oh, man --
Fuckin, Zookerman --
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Haven't thought about it.
Hell you haven't.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Ain't there yet.
Three days, man.
Not yet.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
Hot chocolate.
What?
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
And some pecan pie.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Yeah.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
I'm just saying.
I'm just talking.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Oh.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Aw, Rudy.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
What, working security?
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
Just a roach, Zook.
Good for you. Protein.
Rudy, don't move --
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Standing right here, man!
Alamo...
GUARD!!!
Jesus, Rudy --
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Ash... Ashley...
No, man! No, no, no!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
YOU TELL HER!
...be with her...
NO!!!
...for Christmas...
NICK!!!
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Do what?
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
That was my king!
POP! That was My card!
You're hitting for MY cards!
Switch seats with me.
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
I'M NOT NICK!
Who the hell made this map.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
They changed the layout.
How ya doin', Toothpick?
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
That I should've picked you up?
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin what the fuck. And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
I'll call somebody.
Who?
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
Elois?
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Was he all pissed off?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
How do you know all this?
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
Daddy, did ya see that?
What?
Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
We can work this out, can't we?
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
Bullshit.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  Hi
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show Get Christie Love? She was a black female cop. She always used to say You're under arrest
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
Pam Grier.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him Hey
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Say hello to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
...What bar?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Who, Mr. White?
Yeah.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
How can you tell?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Did the two of you talk?
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah.
A little.
What about?
The Brewers.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
Didja use the commode story?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
What's this?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
What?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
But what is this?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
I gotta memorize all this shit?
I can do that.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
Tell me more about Cabot.
What for?
Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
Jesus Christ!
You can do some crazy things with it.
Let's go over it. Where are you?
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
Myself and Mr. Pink?
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
I'm sorry.
What? Snap out of it!
Just hold on buddy boy.
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
Take a seat.
How is he?
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Wong?
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Mr. Blue's dead?
Dead as Dillinger.
What's that?
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan. I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
What do you care?
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Give me my book.
You gonna put it away?
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
Who gives a damn?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Sorry, it's my book now.
What's she doin' now?
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
What for?
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
How many employees?
No, they're not.
What's the cut, poppa?
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Like hell I am.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
That's your proof?
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Don't ask me that.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
Mr. Pink.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
He don't tip.
He don't believe in it.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
You do?
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
We think we got a rat in the house.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Follow you where?
For what, the cops?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
No, I'm not!
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
I'm okay.
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
Joe.
Bet your sweet ass we are.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
It's not good...
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I can' take you to a hospital.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Lie back down, and try to -
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
What happened?
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
I don't believe in it.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
Fuck all that.
Gun shot.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Dead.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
Let's go in the other room...
I'm cool.
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
Want a smoke?
Why not?
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
That's not correct.
What's wrong with it?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
Look, enough of this Mr White shit -
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
A few cops.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
What do you think?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
Nope.
How can you be so sure?
I got the diamonds.
Where?
Where? Are they out in the car?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
That was the plan, we meet here.
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
What?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
No shit?
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
For all I know, you're the rat.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So, is he dead or what?
He ain't dead.
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
We can't take him to a hospital.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Why!
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
He asked.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, Sorry
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
Of course.
If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
If we don't, he'll die.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
That fuckin did it!
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
Is that supposed to be funny?
We don't think this place is safe.
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
So you wanna git bit, huh?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
You takin' his side?
Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
What are you gonna do about him?
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Not these guys.
Yeah, those guys too.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think Mr. Pink is no big deal, you wanna trade?
I certainly did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Hello.
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
FUCK YOU!
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
GODDAMN YOU!
MOTHERFUCKER!!
It's not fair!!
I didn't do it!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
I certainly was not!
One beer with lunch is hardly drinking.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Did you see her?! She just said Fuck you to me!
Sure I do.
Yeah Ã¹- sure.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
You can?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Where?
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Can we go there now?
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
I don't like this.
Which room is it?
You scared?
Yes.
Let's get out of here.
No.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
I'd like to get out of here.
No.
We can't stand here all night.
Listen Ã¹Ã¹
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
What sort of danger?
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
How much does she want?
I'll give you a check.
I haven't got that much in cash.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
What circumstances?
Why, Mary --
Hello, Frances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -Ã¹ had your picture in her office.
I can't understand it at all.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village Ã¹-	The Dante.
The Dante?
I'll try there.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
But I like teaching school.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I guess most people are.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Thank you.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
I ought to know.
What is it?
I did her hair.
Nothing.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Yes.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Why?
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things Ã¹Ã¹frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -Ã¹ waiting Ã¹Ã¹ I feel as if I'd never known her.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life Ã¹Ã¹ that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -Ã¹ I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her Ã¹Ã¹ to see her Ã¹Ã¹ to touch her Ã¹Ã¹ in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
Good.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
Goodnight, Mary.
This is about another murder Ã¹Ã¹ a woman at Fifty Second Street
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
Yes, of course Ã¹Ã¹ but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
He was a kind little man in his way Ã¹Ã¹ and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
But you have treated me that way.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
I'd like that.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
The people at the restaurant?
Yes.
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
What have you done about Irving August?
Oh, I'm making investigations.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Who the devil is he?
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table Ã¹Ã¹ the one at the feet of Dante.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
What things? Why?
We've tried so long to find her.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
Good night.
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
Gregory Ã¹Ã¹  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -Ã¹ you know that?
Yes.
Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -Ã¹ you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister Ã¹Ã¹ whom I had lost and have found again....
I know Ã¹Ã¹ I shouldn't have told youÃ¹
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
But I'm not joking.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
Well, that's illuminating.
I don't know.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want Ã¹- surrender herself to the police Ã¹Ã¹ stand trial Ã¹Ã¹ I don't think he knows.
We could tell him.
Could you find him?
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
What's that?
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
Not from me.
Please, Jacqueline.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
You'll be all right?
Were you going to make a suggestion?
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
Yes.
And you knew he'd be here.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I have something even better.
I have been at the library.
But you're always at the library.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked perfect by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
Devil worshippers!
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
I can imagine.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it Ã¹Ã¹ to know me better.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me Ã¹-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
I have to go Ã¹-
But you're happy here -- you like your work Ã¹-
It isn't that -- you said, have to go. What could compel you --
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
I had begun to write again -Ã¹that's whet I was doing when you came in.
It's because of Jacqueline Ã¹Ã¹ I can't go on looking for her --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
And you believe that?
If it is true Ã¹ there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
What's wrong, Mary?
I keep telling myself that.
Not I Ã¹- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -Ã¹ My courage like a white plume Ã¹ and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
I understand.
Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you -Ã¹ you're off to work.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything Ã¹Ã¹ and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
What a peculiar question.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
Because there was another girlÃ¹ years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -Ã¹ I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
She was my patient.
What was she to you?
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
I've lost my knack.
After that wonderful first book Ã¹- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
Following me to find Jacqueline?
UhÃ¹huh.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoeÃ¹laces; now this sudden humility.
And this poetry Ã¹Ã¹ like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
Wait Ã¹- there is that other favor.
I'd forgotten.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.
Tell me what?
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -Ã¹ when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
I think it's time.
No other reason Ã¹Ã¹ no woman Ã¹Ã¹not the little Miss Gibson?
Perhaps.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
Perhaps
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
It might have.
I'd like that.
What?
Dr. Judd?
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
Cloven hoof?
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
Would they hurt her?
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
I'd hardly describe It that way Ã¹- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice Ã¹Ã¹ that's it, isn't it?
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
But you would like to know where she is?
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
A gay lot -Ã¹ Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Unless what?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
No. She's no longer under my care.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
I'm very, very serious.
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -Ã¹will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
No, she's with her sister,
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I didn't know.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I'm afraid not.
Yes.
I'll be out in a minute.
Why?
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I don't believe it.
Yes Ã¹Ã¹ yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
But she was here?
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Of course.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
She's very beautiful.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
Because I have something very important to do.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
What's the matter?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
Right.
No.
This one?
This one?
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
Dad!
That's weird.
Who said I was going to die?
I'm scared.
Hi baby.
Does it hurt?
Good.
...I will.
...I will.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
You do?
I see.
Five. The five longest.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Explain, act crazy?
I'm not going to curse.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises then.
Explain noises.
Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.
I cursed.
I heard.
It was very dark.
Yes it was.
It was very dark.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
That roof is over ten feet high.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
That's right.
Morgan, be careful.
I got him.
Do you think it's a possibility?
Yes.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
Do you feel comforted?
Yes.
What does it matter then?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
Should we turn off the lights?
They already know we're here.
They're on the roof.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
This is going to do nothing.
We have to go in the basement.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
They're right behind the door.
He was only a year and half old.
What are you doing?
We won't be able to get out of there.
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
Merrill --
I'm looking!
Merrill!
Got it!
They're distracting us?
I can feel air.
Me too.
I'm close.
They're broadcasting...
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
How many died?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
How do they know it's over?
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
No.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Me too.
Don't touch him.
Graham.
Yes.
It needs batteries.
Edgar, come inside.
These are D's; I need double A's.
We might lose the signal.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
I'm getting out now.
Don't do it.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they're unemployed.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Bimboo?
I just asked his name.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
What's two?
Sounds made up.
Where are we going to sleep?
The family room.
What about Isabelle?
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
They'll read our minds!
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Don't call me Father.
What's that?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Sorry.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
The footprints.
What about them?
There are none.
It's not broken.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
What was the first thing?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.  So he was tall?
I would say so.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
I don't think so.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
No.
No.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
Six months.
And three weeks.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Is he okay?
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Pinned? What does that mean?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
Is that him?
Yeah.
Don't do it!
You'll lose the signal!
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
They think it might happen all at once.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
Don't worry.
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
What book!
They'll find a way in.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Pumpkin?
Yes?
Uh huh.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Eight?
Pick me up?
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
J&B. Straight.
Are we here?
Yes.
Yes, dear.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish. You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Luis is a despicable twit.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
No, you idiot. I said Is it a receptacle tip? Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Is it a what?
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
What do you want, Courtney?
It's a plain end. I think.
Turn the light on.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Why?
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip Ã»  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Maybe.
What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
You and...Luis?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
I never knew you smoked.
You never noticed.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Yes, Courtney?
Yes?
Nothing.
I haven't seen you around here.
Would you like to see my apartment?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
Do you take American Express?
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Nothing like last time, promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Do...what.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Evelyn?
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
We can keep it in the bathroom.
do I know you?
Are you calling me?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
I didn't leave you.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
No, just one.
What were they hiding from?
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
Dr. Crowe.
You're a doctor. What kind?
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Congratulations.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
You use needles?
No.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
That's good.
I'm going to see you again, right?
If it's okay with you?
Why don t you just go for Price?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Everybody has a great body now.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
How do you draw now?
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
You want to ask me a question?
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
You mean aneurysm.
Look over there.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
He your best buddy?
He hates me.
You hate him?
I don't tell her a thing.
Why?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Know what?
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
It's not.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
What'd you write?
Words.
What kind of words?
Upset words.
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
That isn't magic.
What?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Who me?
I didn't know you were funny.
I forgot myself.
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Yes.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Dr. Crowe.
Yes.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
No gas... Hey, that's good.
What makes you think that?
Your eyes told me.
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
Me too.
I want a firm commitment.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
They don't know they're dead?
How often do you see them?
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
...No.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
What?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Never mind.
Yes?
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Them?
Can I ask you then?
Yes.
What do you want more than anything?
I don't know.
I told you what I want.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
I have to.
When?
Soon. One week.
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
what?
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Why? What's wrong?
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
Don't cry.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
You weren't a paper champion.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
Yes.
You believe me, right?
Something happened, didn't it?
Yes, it did.
Yes, I am.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
No, we're not.
You really look better.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
No.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
Just help.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
You do?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I guess she did.
I wish I were somewhere else.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
Don't go home, okay?
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
Maybe.
Really?
And you know what else?
What?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Lots of things.
Anything bad about me?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Don't get mad.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
Maybe.
I'd give anything to have been there.
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Communicate?
Tell you my secrets.
You're really serious, aren't you?
But what about the past? Our past?
You're inhuman.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
Oh my God.
You can see her?
Where is she?
Standing next to my window.
Cole, you're scaring me.
They scare me too sometimes.
Ghosts.
They want me to do things for them.
They talk to you?
...I don't know.
You think I'm a freak?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Got it.
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
What?
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
I know.
She wanted me to tell you--
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
No, no, no.
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Stop it!
You're a stuttering Stanley!
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
Stop looking at me.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
...He doesn't get invited places.
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
How'd he know I'd come?
Meaning?
What are you talking about?
Superstition.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Tramp.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Bitch.
Let me guess. We're going on a long trip.
Someone actually... employs you?
Which street corner?
Hi.
...You any good with those?
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
The band.
Not lately.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Looks like the alternator.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
No shit.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Come on --
Carl, what are you doing?
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Gene.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Sounds familiar.
Bus broke down.
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Nice.
I know her. I knew her.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
You know who I am. You invited me.
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
How... was she called?
Pardon?
Aunt Edith. How did she... die?
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
This is his room... isn't it?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
I'll be fine here.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
She was talking about... a harvest of blood...
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Blood?
You'll be back.
I don't think so.
How did you guess?
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little talk about grandaddy Jethro.
People say he was a murderer.
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? Crazy Old Macdonald! But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
-- It's not me!
It's time to make amends.
Amends...?
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
I --
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Down boy.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Amen.
He's right. You were behind.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Is that right?
Time for a little... feedback guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Yeah?
picked Tonight to come by And watch our set.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Nothing to tell.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
About what?
Name something.
Then why go back now?
Still trying to figure it out myself.
What about Jeremiah?
Nah. Just you.
What's wrong?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
So?
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Let it go.
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... Jethro.
I said that's enough!
No.
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Getting ready.
Look. You want to talk about this?
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Mmmm -- so can I...
You wouldn't understand.
Suzie --
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
Wait a minute --
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
What are --
You're... limping.
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
Suzie... No.
It's you. You and your father.
No --
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Listen to me --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Suzie --
No Mac, please... I --
Don't look.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Get out of here.
No. Not without you --
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
...no... Mac... p-please...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Never.
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Spider.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
Like your guitar break.
Where have you two been?
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Doesn't he live here?
Are you sure?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Carl.
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
Why bother?
I won't...don't worry.
Yes, naturally.
What exactly do you mean?
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Carnes? Wait.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
No, you...didn't?
Uh huh.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Commes des Garcon.
Jesus lives, Luis.
What...is...it?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Maybe it's just the light.
What?
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
Anything on the Swede?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Maybe.
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
He's giving them up?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
What about the sheriff's task force?
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Maroon uniforms?
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
How bad?
Mortal.
No.
Yeah.
Agent Carruthers. do you know Where is he now?
Did he give you his name?
Who?
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
And that didn't seem odd to you?
Are you on a land line?
...About what?
That's not possible. I told you.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
D'you talk to'm?
I got his machine.
What'd you say?
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
Okay.
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
About what?
Look at the collar on that coat...
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a tough
I could have it sent out...
Do you want me to say I did it?
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
...I'm sorry...
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
Without peer?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update.  Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed.  ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink...
That's probably him now...
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, no jail time for my guys.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
They what? What? No. No. Why?
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of The Turnpike Murders that was Sparazza.
I thought Heller was a double op?
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
Leaving what?
It's the last place they'd look.
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
Where's Israel?
What are you doing here?
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
No; we need to handle it now.
I can't discuss --
you can And you will.
You're finished.
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...He does now...
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
...When did you know all this?
...Are you insane?
...Almost.  What do you mean who Sparazza actually was...
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
...So you made another deal?
I wouldn't go that far.
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
You're trying to save Sparazza?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
we needed cohesion to move forward. not conjecture.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
I'm here.
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
-- he's doing it then, huh --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
-- okay, g'head --
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a specialist and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
... Jesus... what for?
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Wow.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Yeah, I can front this.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Shoot.
A million flat.
No shit.
None whatsoever.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
So how we lookin'?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
I'm working on it.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
It's gettin' done Sid.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
good; then All you got to be is grateful.
You love her?
Got hit twice.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
Like a mafucka.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
What are we talkin' on the split...
Why?
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
Fuck you.
What'd you say?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
What's wrong?
Security's locking down the elevators.
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
What?
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Bulllllshit...
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
What else did Padiche say?
What's the time frame?
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Oh really? That's great.
Two at nine? Perfect.
See you then.
Late?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
When?
After six.
Negative. Cancel it.
Oh? And what should I say?
Just...say...no.
Just say no?
Yes, sir.
Oh, something. . romantic?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I'll do it.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
You look nice today.
Yes?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
I said Do not wear that outfit again. Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
You don't like this, I take it?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Thanks, Patrick.
What is it?
Patrick?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
You didn't like him?
It's terrific Win.
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Straight ahead.
Hard to find doors in this place.
Hi.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Uh...
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Right.  That's true.
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
There's a phone in the car.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
What did he say?
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
You live in Manhattan?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Are you nervous?
No, Ma'am.
Would you pick one out, please?
Beg pardon?
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Put it on my account, please.
I got money.
Patrick?
Can you bring Mr...
You can touch me, I won't bite.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Let's get a drink.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
I came on at 8:00.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Listen, that was my fault.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the can the way he did.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
Sooner, the better.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Claire?
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Urdu and Hindi.
Yeah, what a woman.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
You were reading my Renoir.
How did you know?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
No kidding.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Could be, I guess.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Absolutely.  Look at this.
Yes, Patrick?
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
So it was love.
And is...?
Yeah.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
No dog.
But nice.
Very nice.
What about Neil?
You don't like him, do you?
What's to like?
Tell it like it is.
You asked.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
You could do better.
It was nice having you watch over me...
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
Good night, Mike.
What do you want?
I can't open it.
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
You put me life in danger.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Claire, will you calm down?
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Claire...!
Stop, will you?!
Let go!
I do care about you!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Jean?
Yes, Patrick?
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
Yeah.
They called here after you left...
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
Not exactly.
What do you want to do?
I don't know.
You don't want to know.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular marching band.  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Oh that thing in Queens.
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Where?
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
When can I see you?
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Claire...
I'll think about Wednesday.
What a memory.
Do you?
Let's do it.
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
They guys treatin' you all right?
Yeah.
I know.
It wouldn't work.
I know.
I'd miss my life...
... Don't explain.
How long you going away for?
Long enough.
For...?
To... Forget about you.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
Yeah...
... Mike.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Claire!
Mike...?
So.
So.
You still going away?
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
Anywhere you want?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I do.
Say goodbye, Mike.
You take care.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Not if you don't want me to.
... I don't want to talk about it...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
And I'm making mine.
Keep what handy?
Nothing.
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Sure we are, let's go!
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
I don't know Tommy.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Dorsia is...fine.
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Absolutely.
Tommy...!
I'm all right.
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Too kinky.
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Mike?
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
Get in bed.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
You got no idea...
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
So how'd it go?
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
For how long?
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
I can still use a gun.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Hey.  The neighbors.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Okay?
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Oh, some shit.
What shit, honey?
You don't want to hear about it.
Honey.  You got him.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
She's got to identify him.
I think -- she's crazy.
I'd identify him.
I might stop you.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
It's not your taste.
What did she say the down payment was?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
She bought it.
Why?
Coming to bed?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
I'll be right up.
What?
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
Mike, take it easy...
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?!!
Jean? Sorbet?
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
D'you have to say fucking every other word?
What was that?
You heard me.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I watched TV.
What did you watch?
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
You talked to his wife?
Let me drive...
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
What about Tommy?
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
No.
Ellie...
Want a bite?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
Me neither.
I just sat and listened.
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
What about when she goes out?
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Even Joey Venza?!
What about when she identifies him?!
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
At my house...!
No, I need'm now!
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
Right behind you, T.J.
Who's Joey Venza?
You in this with me?
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Yes.
... Hard?
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Is she injured?
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, not really.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
I'll prove it!
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
Let my kid go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Watch your step!
What're we having?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
How do you know where the gun is?
I know where everything is.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
Lay back, Mack.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
Yeah, I think so.
How are things going, pal?
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What plans?  You and Mom got plans?
She's taking singing lessons.
She's what?
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
We're gonna pass the street.
You coming in?
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a singing lesson than have dinner with your father...
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting.
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
Take care, pal.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Sorry.
Jean? What?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
No. No, that's okay.
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
NoÃ not really.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Remember Little League?
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
No, no.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
I'm always here, Pete.
Hmmmm.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Harry!
HarryÃ 
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
I know.  I've got one too.
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
That's not even close.
Are you okay?
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Right.
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Can we make it a hundred?
Can't focus...
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Mr. Jameson--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Mr. Jameson--
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
How about tomorrow?
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Just call me Spidey.
Thanks, I already ate.
Well...
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
Good morning, Liz.
It's too early to be clever.
Huh?
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
Thank God.
but the dogs treed him between Huxley And Kafka.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
My my.
What?
But you like that in a man?
Does it have a human name?
I've gotta study.
Hi, Adele.
I'm sure you kept warm.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
I've got no problems.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
I think I'd like that.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
You'd feel what?
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Strong...
I'm here...
Hello, Liz.
I... I like you.  A lot.
...to the office this afternoon.
Why?
Just...say...no!
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Nah.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
That's the understatement of the year.
What do you think I do?
No. Flattering, but no.
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Oh, Peter. A zit.
I'll introduce you.
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
I'm a photographer, remember?
It's Friday night...
Yes.  Do you have a date?
No.
What the hell is that?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Absolutely no class.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Use a fork.
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Aunt May, what happened?
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
How is he?
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
Welt...it depends, why?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
That's...that's too bad.
What?
No. I really don't.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Actually, I got this spider biteÃ 
Really, Professor, I--
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Need any more help?
Hello
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
NoÃ 
Why? It is a wrestling match, orÃ 
Like it?
So they're airing this tonight?
What?
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Imagine how I feel.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
Well.
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
Just drop me off here.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Phooey on that.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Next Saturday?
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. MatinÃše of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
She's my...cousin.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I?
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Who?
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
No.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on Page Six at least.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
No, really. I'm okay.
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Shoot.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
Nice. Very nice.
Thanks.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
You seem...nervous.
Bad habit.
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
No problem.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Data?
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
Data, are you all right?
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
What do you mean?
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Well...
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
This is its current position.
Can you project its course?
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
I believe so.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
I believe so.
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
That's where he's going.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
And destroy every planet in the system.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Population?
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
Commander.
Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
Is she still angry?
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yale thing?
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
Agreed.
Well?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Really? What do you feel?
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
I get it. I get it.
You get what?
What?
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
Thanks.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, this isn't the time.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
Data, are you all right?
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
One minute to warp core breach.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go to school?
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
What happened to you?
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
Your sixth sense- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
You're in the Nexus.
This is the Nexus?
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an echo of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Left behind?
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Soran?
All of us.
Where is he now?
Wherever he wanted to be.
These are my children...my children.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Why would you want to leave?
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
I don't understand.
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
Don't you know this?
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Yes, yes, it is.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
Better?
Antonia?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Actually, yes.
Hmmm.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Oh.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
That's right.
I hadn't planned on it.
That's right.
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Yes.  Thank you.
Have you consulted a psychic?
No.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Nothing.
People just...disappear.
Eerie. Really eerie.
What's normal?
No.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
No, I didn't know that.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Make it so.
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
Thank you, Number One.
Understood. That will be all.
Report.
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
All right, all right. You've made your point.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Doctor Soran?
We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
The Nexus.
Thank you.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for formal questioning?
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Mr. Chekov -- ?
An energy reading from 'C deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Will we get another ship?
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Response?
Nothing. As before.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Aye, sir.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Still no response, sir.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
I don't believe it...
Why don't we beam it up?
Not from here, no.
Thank you... Sir!
Hello, sir. It's David.
David... Sorry I'm late.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
David!... What went wrong?
David, I don't understand...
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
It's a little early to celebrate.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
A photon tube...!
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Short range scan.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
There shouldn't be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've got to find out what it is...
... Or who.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
I'll handle that later.
My readings indicate great instability.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
.          .. Spock's tube...
David --
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
What is it?
Spock's burial robe.
Later. Let's go...
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
What?
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well, I could he wrong.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Logic indicates that is the case.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
That may be difficult...
Why don't you just call for help!
Not exactly.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
Did your collaborator know?
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
This planet is aging in surges.
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
... How long?
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
I don't understand.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I'll go...
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Captain, what's happening?!
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Mr. Scott...
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Mr. Scott?
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Not a big music fan, eh?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
I'll be there.
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Good shooting, Scotty.
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
What's wrong?
How many more?
Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
What happened...?
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Is there anything we can do?!
The Genesis planet is gone.
Goodbye, David.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
My God...
Much is at stake...
No hash browns?
Not in the mood, I guess.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Suit yourself, I guess.
Yes. And I know you.
You would have done the same for me.
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Count on our help, sir.
I'll need it, Sulu.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
But Marcus denied it?
See! That shimmering area.
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
... A cloaking device?
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Fire, Mr. Scott!
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
About a dozen officers and men.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
Close... There --
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Go, Sulu!
We are clear and free to navigate.
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
He does? You're sure?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and Ã»  - you.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd stay there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Indisposed, sir.
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
May I ask why...?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, please! I can make them understand!!
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
Who is this?! How dare you --
David?... David!
Wait! Give me a chance --
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Give me your hand and we both live.
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Met his death?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
I -- saw no future --
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was in death
Yes, I was...
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
But -- why?
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Then, how --
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Of course...!
... He spoke of your friendship.
Yes...
He asked you not to grieve...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
Yes... But -- how...?
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
What you ask is difficult.
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you must.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Listen, what's your name?
Speak up. Come on.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
I'm not a drama critic.
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Uh -- what are they?
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
I've been great. And you?
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
They even killed the galley chief.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Our first order of business is survival.
Now that's what I call a meal.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
Nobody goes there anymore.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Carol!
Wait --
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
You did this -- in a day?!
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
But we can't just sit here -- !
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
Cecelia is, well...you know
Another Martini, Paul?
I'm Admiral Kirk...
We were still there, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
Where's Dr. Marcus --
I'm Doctor Marcus!
Why didn't you tell me?
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
It's a long story.
We appear to have plenty of time.
It's the Genesis Wave!
What?
He's on a build up to detonation!
How soon --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
You can't!
I don't mean to intrude.
Are you running away from me?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I didn't expect anything.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
I'm trying, David.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I am truly sorry.
Let go -- he can't -- !
Only half of you would get there.
What are you looking at?
Don't you believe it.
I don't know.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Yes, Owen?
Yes, it is.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Genesis, what's that?
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using our console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
KHAN!
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
We'll be going to warp speed --
Scotty -- what's left?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Uhura. Can't you augment?
Try the emergency channels...
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Spock?
Scotty, let's have it.
On screen.
Do it, while we have time.
Sensors, Captain?
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Yes, Spock.
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
You are a fanatic.
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
I am understandably curious.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
The Kobayshi Maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Home.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
Or the one.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
How far?
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
Make him?
Carol Marcus --
Yes.
It literally is Genesis...
The power of creation --
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
What's she doing here?
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
It would explain a great many things --
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
They knew just where to hit us.
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Too late --
Not enough against their shields.
Who the hell are they?
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
The prefix code?
It's all we've got.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
I can paint anywhere.
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Affirmative, Admiral.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Regula is class D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially
A distinct possibility.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Aye sir --
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Be careful, Jim...
What IS working around here?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
That's it?
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
Best speed, Scotty...
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Uhura, patch me in --
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
Yes --
... the good of the few...
Or the one.
I never took the Kobayashi Maru test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Spock...!
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
Kirk here.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
Any suggestions, Admiral?
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Very well.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
And why not?
Because... there was no way to win.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
... No, sir. It has not.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
It is still regulation, Admiral.
May I speak, sir?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
You earned it.
I did not think so.
You're bothered by your performance on the Kobayashi Maru.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
May I ask how you dealt with the test?
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Take the test again.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Energize defense fields.
Khan!
Who?
Reliant's command...
On screen...
We're finding it.  Please, please -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Phasers on stun. Move out.
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
Erased...
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Stage Two of what?
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
Admiral?
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
The Kobayashi Maru, sir.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
WHAT?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
That was close --
Hold your course. Look sharp...
At what.
All stop, sir.
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
It's important.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Aye, sir.
Time from my mark...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Time!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Distance from Reliant...
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Aye, sir.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Understood, sir.
Dismiss the company.
Admiral on the bridge!
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Aye, sir --
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
Stop engines.
Engage warp engines --
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
Scotty!
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
I did nothing -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
Try again.
Battle stations.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
...But?
Didn't you visit the campus?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
You saved my life in alot of ways.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Course heading, Captain?
Prepare for warp speed.
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Fire all phasers...!
No power to the weapons system, sir.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Never, sir.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
Aye, sir.
Certainly...
By the book...
That took some fun out of --
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
Milo! What about --?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, Did you really do this just today? Cause I was impressed. He said What're you implying?
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
He's your boss. He's not your --
Isn't that -- extreme?
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
What!
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
They hack into people's programs?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
Like this? It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
Milo. Why would he --
How should I know? Solving a problem
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
I can't just walk away!
You can't just walk in, either.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
...Whaddo I do?
So you believe me?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Nothing.
Nothing?
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
...Why?
Remember Lyle Barton?
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
I remember.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
That was -- different.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Look at this.
What?
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Milo --
Milo, you --
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
Don't panic...
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
But not you.
There are days.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
Will it?
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
A perfect moment?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
Great!
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
... an offlander?
For someone so young.
There are caves in those mountains.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you just haven't gotten around to it yet...
What's the rush?
I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
I'll be here.
...What?
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
You're what?
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I understand.
I don't.
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
I aspire to be more than I am.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Perhaps, that is true.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Really?
Really.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Sometimes I do.
My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
Do machines ever play?
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
No, I mean...
Chase me!
For what purpose?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Androids... don't have...fun.
No one's ever asked me that before.
If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
Anij!
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Bye.
Oh, right. Hold on.
Can he breathe under water?
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
No.
The artificial lifeform was right?
If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
Very funny...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Will he live?
Captain, Geordi...?
You're aboard the Enterprise.
Yes... that looks like them.
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...
Here we go.
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
How about a passive radiation scan?
A ship,
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
I don't know.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
How many?
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
I believe it is safe, sir.
...wanna savor this.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
You're just afraid to eat it.
Another time.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You're not going to launch anything until...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
No.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Prick.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
Understood.
Good luck. Dougherty out.
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
Your Briar Patch turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
A planet in Federation space...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
The Ba'ku.
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours.  There is still a way home, Gal'na.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
Scan for lifesigns.
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
Are they...?
Do you have everything you need from command?
Right... What's that mean again?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Do you know how they were damaged?
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
Fail-safe?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Full impulse.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Will that stop the tear?
That's your expert opinion?
Why not?
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
On screen.
Eject the core.
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
How long 'til they reach us?
What's inside that nebula cluster?
Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.
Remind me to lodge a protest...
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Deck ten.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
Who is it?
Commander Riker...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
We're not going anywhere.
Deck five.
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
Aye, sir.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
You've not aged a day since then?
Ask them.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Worf, you must hurry...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Captain...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir?
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
Make it so.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Beam him out!
Scanners are off line!
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  A British tar is a soaring soul
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Transferring controls to manual.
No, sir...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Gorch?
Picard to Crusher...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
You're living here?
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
We have to find shelter...
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
One. It's Ru'afo.
Can you beam him off?
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
Counselor?
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
Why was Data assigned?
Environmental concerns, again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
Wine, women and song.
You should feel right at home with them.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Why would we be involved with these people?
Good question.
You haven't done that in a long time...
What...?
What you're doing to my neck...
Was I doing something to your neck?
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
No children?
If that's true, they're a dying race.
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Whatever makes you comfortable...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
But it's comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.
You're in quite a mood today.
... I believe you...
... I'm not sleeping well...
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Augh.
Augh?
All hands. Battle stations!
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
Absolutely.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Yes...
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
It's Cochrane.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Are you saying they won't help us?
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
What'd they ever do for you?
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
That'll be interesting.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
You actually performed surgery...?
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
Not yet.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our sense of duty. We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
At least four hours.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Wanna be a part of history?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
I do not know what you are referring to.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
Do you know what this is, Data?
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
No. I will not betray my friends.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I... do not want this...
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
More lies.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
I'm your creator now.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Yes...
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
No... no, please... you cannot...
Isn't it better like this...?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Gimme the coordinates?
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
Vulcan?
No.
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Can you configure it?
I believe so.
Do it.
Dispersive armor is holding.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Ready quantum torpedo.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
What?
I have helm control.
Where's the Sphere?
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
Contact Starfleet Command.
What year is it?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
Is it your dish?
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Who are you?
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Juice?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Understood. Keep me informed.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
Let's go.
This must be it.
How serious is the damage?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
I have the password right here.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
There should be some kind of manual release...
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
Ready to make a little history?
Always am.
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
Captain --
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go now.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
No... the door's too thick.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
What's still there?
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
Engage.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
I'm on it...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
Captain, the Enterprise!
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Their com system must still be down.
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Yes.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
California. San Francisco.
There's a few of us left.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Yes.
Something wrong with that?
What do you want?
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Yes, he is.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Cochrane?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
I'm very sorry.
Did you need something?
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Money. So you can get dome money...
I can try.
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
Oh hi.
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
'Fraid not.
What?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
Were the two of you... involved?
How did you know about that?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
I'd say you already have.
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
We?
Friends from Cornell...
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
Or...?
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
I am not a thief...
You're leaving, aren't you?
I have to...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
No. It's a lot further than that.
No... I'm from France.
That's impossible.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
On screen.
He's pretty tight with his family.
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
Life signs?
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Track their weapons fire.
Port battery, ready sir!
Fire.
Aye, sir.
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Go to manual.
Target locked!
Fire!
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Aye, sir.
Who's that?
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Onscreen.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
Report.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Life signs?
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
Captain?
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
Good luck, sir.
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
Unless you'd like to stay.
...Hello?
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
What the hell is happening, Worf?
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
What are they doing?
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Destroy the deflector dish.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Cool!
Would you like a Coke or something?
Oh. No thanks.
Are you alright?
Just a little queasy...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Right.
And Commander, whatever you do... do not vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
I'll keep that in mind.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Understood!
Report!
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
Nothing.
Report.
Where the hell are they going?
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
I remember it made me sick.
Hold that thought.
You know a lot about art, I guess.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Commander... we have a problem.
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Target...
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
What kind of message?
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Skywire.
Good luck, Captain.
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
I believe the operation is over.
The charge is murder.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
You may need assistance, doctor...
Fascinating...
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Vulcans sleep lying down...
Spock, that was actually funny.
We DO sleep lying down.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
Or not to be -
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
What the Hell's going on?
I wish I knew. Uhura?
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
No!
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Figures.
We've been set up all along.
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
We're not finished.
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
Kobayashi Maru...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Are we playing multiple choice?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Specifically of...?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
Don't remind me.
I do!
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
No way.  You see this?
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan...
If they're even looking for us...
Spock's looking for us...
ARE YOU CRAZY?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
Damned clever if you ask me...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Come on...
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
To be -
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of exploration...
Now there's a poser.
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
We were until your torpedoes!
Then let me help!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
Stand...?
Retire.
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
I was nervous -
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
That's a comfort...
'Think I should buy some originals?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
That's what I told her. My wife.
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Would you care to go topside?
Very much.
To be or not to be, that is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
I beg your pardon?
My God, what happened here?
You feign ignorance?
WHAT HAPPENED?
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
He's a DOCTOR!
How can I trust --
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He just tried to save him!
Take them away.
What?
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
I checked the data banks, yes.
And what did they tell you?
That isn't true...!
That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Are those your words?
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Those words WERE spoken by me.
You were demoted...
Yes.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
Well, I -
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
I am.
So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Your honors, the State rests.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
They're preparing to fire.
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
Klingon blood.
It's okay. Really.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
You did this -- overnight?
You're making me young again.
We must do this again soon.
I've heard of chameloids - Shapeshifters - I thought you were mythical.
An accident wasn't good enough...
Your friends are late...
What took you so long?
Not me, idiot - HIM!
He's got it.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
How did you know...?
We didn't kill Gorkon.
How much time's left of your sentence?
Milo. What's up?
Well -- you sent for me.
Right... Right.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Except us.
Possibly.
Candidate for what?
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Energize...
Stand down your weapons.
Captain, if --
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Aye, sir.
This is incredible -
WHO ELSE...?
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
You really wrote this just today?
What're you implying.
Nothing!
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Right -
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
I hope you're happy.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
Uhura, signal our surrender.
Who is US?
Starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a Court Martial on this ship, Lieutenant. Win, lose or draw it will be on your record.
You hear that?
Sulu!
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
When does this conference start?
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I'm sure.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
You have personally -
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
They're dying.
LET THEM DIE.
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
Never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
What is it?
I am uncertain.
Spock, I'm really tired...
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
From Enterprise?
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
We HAVEN'T fired -
It scales, don't you think?
Definitely.
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
Perhaps you're right.
Captain...
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
The peace conference.
What peace conference?
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
Why would they give them to us?
Are you dining on worms?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter S. You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
I SHOULD have been -
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
But I am not human. I am only -
Spock, you want to know something?
Close enough to beam down?
Not yet... Section 4236...
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
Make ourselves a target?
Were the flags for Teddy?
What's she waiting for?
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - the undiscovered country...
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
... is to trust him.
WE SURRENDER.
Who else?
Uhura?
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
Had you talked to him much lately?
Did you?
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Oh. Yeah.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
That the universe will unfold as it should.
Her own father...?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
An omission. After that -
Any progress?
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
An error.
If you are logical.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
The wrong place?
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
NO WAY!
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
A computer canna lie, sir.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
That could take hours!
And if they're still in place?
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
I know precisely where he'll be.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
Would they?
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
This one can.
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
I believe I am.
- could take weeks; sir.
Gary, hi.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
Sure.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it Plasma - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a system. Losers
What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
Yes, please continue.
Do you know who I am?
No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
Do you know where you are?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Is that your final answer?
Because you are dangerous.
I know.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Indefinitely.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little oleÃ† me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I donÃ†t show up for my physical on time!
It'll serve you right.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
...Worse?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  Get your head out of that machine
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  ThereÃ†s no crying in Starfleet.
When was he... created?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
I think a skin cellÃ†s the more likely of the two.
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
Beverly, come in.
Remember him?
He turned out all right.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
Yes.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
Dying?
How long does he have?
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
That's great! Thanks.
'Sorry about the late notice...
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. CochranÃ†s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
That was another time.
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
Not tonight, I have work here.
Soon then.  IÃ†ll save the last dance for you.
So... To happy endings.
To happy endings.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would miss you.
Now, you make a toast.
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
He is very observant.
I can see that.
Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice...  You left my party to send E-mail?
Data!
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
On my way.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
A bit less florid, Data.
A weapon.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
It'll only work for one of us.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
What do you imagine this is?
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Ready, Captain.
How long until we reach the fleet?
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
For now we see but through a glass darkly... He said he's a mirror.
Of you?
Yes.
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
He would deny a human connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
How can you be sure?
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
We are losing dorsal shields.
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
We are being hailed.
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Negative.
Sir.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Gary, I --
You see what's hanging on the wall?
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. IÃ†d say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
Do you have a name, sir?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
An individual more like you, you mean.
Yes.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
What purpose does this serve?
No, I do not mind.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
I am not.
What is our approximate distance?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
The resemblance is... striking.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
Thank you.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... IÃ†m a talking head.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
May I have this dance?
Do you have a moment, sir?
Of course, sit down.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a family is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
I don't believe that, sir. WeÃ†ve shared many disappointing journeys.
I'm going to miss you.
And I you.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
I don't know.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
How could I not?
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
I know how he thinks.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Counselor?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Make it so.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
This isn't about me anymore.
I'm only half human.
Imzadi. This is so good.
No!
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
This isn't real.
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
You sick bastard!
You're not here.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
No.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
This is good. Who did it?
Understood.
Open a channel.
Thank you, Commander.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
What do we know about the planet?
Theories?
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
What do we know about the population?
Cannon fodder.
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
What programs were accessed?
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
What's he doing?
He wants to look me in the eye.
What'd the girl say?
Sir?
WeÃ†ve got him!
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Aye, sir.
Ready, sir!
How long until he can fire?
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Sir, we wonÃ†t be able to bring you back. ItÃ†s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
That's an order, Commander.
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
Sir, we're being hailed.
On screen.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
I'll take care of it, sir.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
Not with the Romulans.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
That will never happen.
WonÃ†t do what, Mister Worf?
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
What sort of signature?
If you don't mind.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
On screen.
Who was it?
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
On screen.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
What's this?
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Still well on our side...
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Thank you, sir...
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if youÃ†ll excuse me.  IÃ†ll be in the gym.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Sir --
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
A coup d'etat?
Why don't they answer our hails?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
It's working.
Counselor?
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
Can anything be done for him?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
And the Romulans invade.
We can only hope so.
Report.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Agreed.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
She's the most beautiful ship IÃ†ve ever seen.
But she's not the Enterprise.
Anything.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
I intend to.
Let's go.
Wait... He knows.
Just do it.
Serving with you has been an honor.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
Praetor Shinzon?
And you're not as we imagined you.
No?
Praetor?
I've never met a human woman.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Praetor Shinzon. WeÃ†re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
And the Senate supports you?
I have dissolved the Senate.
Right now, youÃ†re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
Yes.
And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
Yes.
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
You know I do.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
We need to talk, just you and I.
You know I need to verify this.
I know.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
How did you end up on Remus?
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
No race should be a slave to another.
I have no reason to.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youÃ†d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Were we always explorers?
Yes.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
New worlds.
After you, Praetor.
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
There is that.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
I know.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
You do?
In time, Jean Luc.
Why am I here?
What are you doing?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile.
All of this so you could capture me?
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe IÃ†ll snap its ugly head off.
What's this all about?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I won't defend my life to you.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
We are.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Why are you here?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
And what of the Enterprise?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
You know that's not possible.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Long ago.
Not so long.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
I see more than what you are.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
He is what his life has made him!
Yes.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
I don't know.
But you want to.
That's your life... not mine.
ItÃ†s too late.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Just thought his work should go on.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Those really weird, short lines.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
I am.
Report!
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
So theyÃ†ve got him up and running.
Runs in the family.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Let's go.
Are we prepared?
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Find her again.
Do as I tell you!
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
How long until we reach the Rift?
You heard me.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
Cool.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
None.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
You don't have to understand.
I have a purpose.
Silence, Romulan!
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guardÃ†s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Now go. I have some personal business.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
Lisa.
You know my name.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
...Were you?
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
...Something like that. Yeah.
Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
Did I say something?
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
What've you got there?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Show me.
No. Please.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
There is no second place. Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
Long story. Not that interesting.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
She saved my life.
I snuck into 
Why would you do a thing like --
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
The Day Care?
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
But why would they --?
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make sense. I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Just not the eyes.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Oh yeah?
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it being wired
A star is born.
Leave him alone, Tran.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
I made my choice, Lenny.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
Fuck you.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
I live for the moment.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his act of revenge.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
What're you going to do?
You can't just... kill him.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Jesus.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
Watch and see.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Forget it's there.
Make me forget it, baby.
Cut it out, Tran.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
...Milo?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
No, no. Never.
Faith, call me, okay?
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
I'm already hurting.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
He has his uses too.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Maybe.
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
Can't do it.
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say The End. You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Who did it?
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
What's going on?
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
We should talk alone.
No.  Mace is in this.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
What a nightmare.
What about the FBI?
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
Who can we trust?
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
Step into my office.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Least you can do.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
Thanks, Max.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
You were lucky, Max.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
Do we post it on the Net?
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
I'm on her.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Yeah.  No, not really.
Let's work it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
He records himself raping and killing her--
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
So've I.  Too much.
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
Why me?
W'sup, Max?
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Looks like she was holding out.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
He's been cooked-off
Is he dead?
No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
What stuff?
Jesus.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
Okay... what about Strickland?
No.  Bad idea.
What do you mean?
Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
I intend to.
Only way I could stand your ties.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
Jesus!
You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
You bet.  Did you like it?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
I won't say anything.
I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
You got froggy on me a couple times.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
Say there's just one mole working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Sorry.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
What else you got?
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
Well... the guy's fucked up.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
What clip?  What was it?
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
She never gave me a tape.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Time?
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
It's alright.  He means it.
Strickland.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Your sex life?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Sleaze to peddle.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Define illegal.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Define love.
What's his name?
Fumitsu.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
What?
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
What the fuck are you doing?
Coming with you.
Are we having a bad night?
Let's talk in the car.
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
In LA?  Are you crazy?
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
Get it.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
I thought we were friends.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Jesus, Lenny.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
Forget her.
She still loves me.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
She's my destiny.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
You'll see.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
A what?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
No idea.
What is it?
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Black.  Jack.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Are you sure it's real?
Wants to share.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
Is this great fabric or what?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Never really thought about it.
So that gives you something.
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
Why were you so careless?
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
No more, Lenny.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
It's not your fault.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
But that doesn't add, does it.
No it doesn't.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
She said If they get me.  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
So the guy's not a sicko.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
That's where it gets a little strange.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
Sure.
How's Zander?
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
Whatup Lenny?
Where we going?
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
What is it?
This tie doesn't go with blue!
Why were you snooping in my office?
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
You better keep a low profile for a while.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  A Love Supreme. Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Something in your car...
Lenny, give them the tape.
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Shit!
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
This is bad.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Fire's out, isn't it?
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
You sure?
It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
Well, look at the plus side.
There's a plus side?
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
How long does it last?  Oh.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Who's Strickland?
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
I'm not going.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
No.  It didn't.
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
A beautiful geek? What're the chances?
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
You never told me.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
No, it's not.
Mace... you're a girl.
Got your ticket?
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
You see Tran?
Uh unh.
Alright.  We're going up.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
Take it to him.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
No.  Trust me.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Yeah, right.  Fucked.
Are we under arrest?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Yeah.  We did.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I owed so much to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
See you downtown.
Yeah.  See you there.
Just Lenny.
Are you going to make me beg?
What is that?
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
Take the tape to the cops.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
You really want that on your head?
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Oh.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Was this him?
Besides that.
Testa?
Have you had a chance to think about --
No.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
You run the plates?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
That's right, Jan.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
That's lame, isn't it?
You'll come up with something.
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
You're thinking...?
Who knows.
Agent Mackelway.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
What's the bad news?
You tell me.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Hey, Sheriff.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her.
Dylan here.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Hi there.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
You heard?
What?
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
You have the body?
She's buried.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
Does he know you know?
Why?!
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Please don't go.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Meet me at the other location.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
What did he look like?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
He was sitting here?
What kind?
Put a BOLO out on that.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
We have another one.
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
Please.
It's three years old, it --
Bring it to the other location.
But you said the other --
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
I think I talked to him.
Speck. Harold Speck.
MyDick.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Then why do I still have a badge?
He got away. I had him. He got away.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
Go ahead.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
What I do requires confidentiality.
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
Maybe it's the satellite.
Let's try 
Was?
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
How long ago?
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was Imelda. Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Huh?, sir.
I was visiting an old college friend.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I was looking for a pattern.
I didn't use Low's name.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
...He knows.
What?
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to 
Thanks for the ride.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
None taken.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
You work with Koessler?
Not especially.
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
This is a sexy case.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Doesn't fit.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That information's being withheld from the media.
A very sexy case.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
Yes I do.
It explains a lot.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
Don't even go there. What's up?
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes ghosted
What about the chat rooms themselves?
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying friends to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, How to Plant Perennials. Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
The other reason?
You want to have dinner?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
They're all criminals?
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
Gone live?
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: I went live last month.
This is some serious shit.
You got a point there.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
What's that?
Sex.
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
He thinks he looks young.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
Don't be too harsh.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
Huh?
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Oh yeah, I forgot.
There are Agency regulations about this.
It's a no-no.
I know.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
Not yet. Not about this, either.
Find the feet?
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
We did find these, however.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
The tattoo?
Sue Ann Hanson.
You mean --
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
You did.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Oh.
...You got my E-mail?
Is that how Larry feels?
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
That's true.
Then there's the other issue.
What's that?
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
And nobody else can do that?
Not the way I can.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
I just need to go a little slow.
Hello?
Jaime? Where are you?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
What's up?
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Suspect Zero.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
You were right. He found me.
And you're working with him?
Does one exist?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
But why this pattern?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Tom, you okay?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
What's going on?
It's quite advanced.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as burn residue. Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
All the same killer?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
I...
Jaime --
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
How are we going to find him?
Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information.
What happened?
I'm going to Amarillo.
Kulok.
Sit back.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
I'll be back.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
Who are you?
Yes.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
He's moved on to TV.
What was your weakness, sir?
Suspect Zero?
I don't carry it with me.
Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession...
Zero killed them all?
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
You knew it was me all along?
Who told you about her?
It was the mall.
Those were just fantasies.
Maybe you should back off.
You? You went by the book?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
I've been to Chicago.
If I owe, I will go.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
I want to help you.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
I want to go live with you.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thomas Mackelway.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
I don't know.
What d'you mean?
What does that mean?
I didn't plan this.
I screwed up twice, sir.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Yes, sir.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
Koessler?
No.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the item screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
I talked to him.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
I don't think you understand.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
It's over for you.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
What're they building?
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Yes.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
I'll come to you when I need you.
You have to answer for Santino.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
Good, good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
No, just you and Paulie.
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
You take care of Paulie?
OK, but be careful.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
How bad will it be?
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Maybe less...
You understand him better than anyone.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
This morning.
Should I bring him in.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Yes.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
You mean Tattaglia.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tom said he'd take care of it.
For bravery.
For killing a man.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
No.
Then why have I become a man like you?
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
How did you find out?
I'll need him.
How?
Yes.
Don Tommassino.
I know.
Corleone.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Don Tommassino...I should see this place.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
What is it?
How do you know I come from America?
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Yes.
Shhhhh.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
You look good, too.
No.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Who are those girls?
Give them some money and send them home.
Get rid of them...
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Okay.  One minute.
Is the hospital covered?
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
We're all tired...
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
We should hear what they have to say.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
And when they shot me father...
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
One of Tattaglia's people?
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
Jesus, I don't know...
Can you do it Mike?
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
Will you give this to him.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
I'm German-Irish.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Thanks Tom.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Right.
What about McCluskey?
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Mike, why am I out?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
Did he give you his politicians?
How will they come at you?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
Al Capone!
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Michael...
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Michael, I love you.
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
He's coming over here!
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
How do you do.
My brother, Tom Hagen.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
Sure.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
And what do you want for Christmas?
Just you.
What will your father say?
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
What time do they expect us?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael.
Michael, what are you doing?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
Michael?
I'm thinking about it.
Michael...
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
Hello.  Kay?
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
I love you.
I LOVE YOU.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Huh?
Tell me you love me.
I can't...
Please say it.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
When will I see you again?
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
When will I see you again?
Goodbye.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
Oh Michael.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Let HER ask.
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
Will you?
Let me think about it, O.K.?
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Tell me!
Is it true?
You just stand here one minute...
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
I can help you out...
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
What?
One of them fingered the old man.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Until the old man tells me different.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
Where are you going?
Send some bodyguards.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
I won't panic.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
Cut it out.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
The kid's right.
Go on Mike.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
A million times.
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
We're going to New Jersey?
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Yes, I promise.
I do renounce him.
I do renounce them.
I do wish to be baptized.
Just be patient.
Be patient.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
He talked to you?
Thanks.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You're unlucky.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Yeah.
I think so.  Detective squad?
Is he alive?
Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming.
What are you doing in Mongi?
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sure. Any time.
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
You just woke up!
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Well, we ate everything without you.
We?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Is that good?
Shut up!
What? What?
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Uncanny!
I don't get it.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
It's vile.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Okay, darling.
You'd say if you mind?
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
I don't like you.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Oh, it was.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Yes please!
Okay.
He's drowning me!
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Who's this?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
It's just an undercoat.
That's funny.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
No, still here.
I'm intruding.
Can you mix a martini?
Sure.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
What? What's this?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I met him in New York.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
What?
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
I'm never going back!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
You like jazz!
I love jazz.
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
This is so good of you.
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Your parents met her.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
Sure. I love Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
You're breaking my ribs!
What?
You're breaking my ribs!
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
I played piano in a few places.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Copy out from here...
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
I know. I write like a child.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
Well we certainly know that's true.
Do you have any brothers?
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
No!
I didn't mean with you in it.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
What does he say?
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Relax.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
What club?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
Shoes too?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Is Freddie here?
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
That's good.
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Why?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Ha.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
What?
So cool.
So tell me.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Really? To Italy?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Oh God, I don't think so.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Marge and I are getting married.
How?
How?
You love me and you're not marrying me.
Tom, I don't love you.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
What?
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
What evening?
Frederico!
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Sure.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.
Aye, aye.
Hello?
Who is it?
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
I guess.
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
What about Christmas?
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
You should watch that!
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Have you done something to your hair?
Freddie, do you have something to say?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Is it on delle Croce
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Mr Greenleaf.
Yes it is.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Such as?
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
What's going on?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
He's not a man, he's a god.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
That ring's so great. The green one.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
It's superb.
Frances?
My fiancÃše.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
I'm fine.
Are you okay?
Sure.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
So I'm learning.
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
What about Cortina?
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
Dickie!
I'll go and see what's the matter.
I'll go.
Hello Marge.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Ha. Did he say why?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
What does that mean?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
I think you're right.
Oh my God. Tom.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Is he really not here?
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie did it.
Dickie?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
What?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Where does Dickie live?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Hello Marge!
Tom.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
That's a terrific idea.
Look at me what?
To the manner born.
Very.
And you, sir? Any better?
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
Tom?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I can explain.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Marge? Where are you going?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
I told you. He gave them to me.
Why? When?
I don't believe you.
It's all true.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Oh Marge.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
I told you! I knew it!
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
How would you know that?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
No glasses.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
Do you know Tom?
I hope so.
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
So you found Peter...
I think we sort of found each other.
Where's Dickie's father?
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
Is this you?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
This is spectacular.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
What's funny?
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
What's your secret?
Excuse me?
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Hello.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Which is?
Emily.  Just kidding.
As in the...?
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Randall.
Right.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
What?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
I know.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
I'll take them both.
Let's go.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
Okay then, you're crazy.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Exactly. 10.30 --
Dickie, my God!
Hello Meredith.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
What?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
Of course. Aunt Joan.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
I've thought about you.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
You're kidding.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
You know what -- I am.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Where have you been since then?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Ditto.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Thanks.
I can't later.
And tomorrow?
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Ten thirty?
We'll be there.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
My God.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
It's okay.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
That's good, isn't it?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
No.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
What did he say?
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
No key, huh?
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Do you want me to stick around?
It's okay.
Or I could come back.
Tom, are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.
I give up.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Nothing.
Hello. What are you up to?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
How was it?
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was that Meredith?
Was who Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Why lie?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Or Tom and Peter even.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Peter, I... I...
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
...Tom is a mystery...
Yes?
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Postmortem?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
No.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Of course. What happened to your face?
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
What about Ripley?
November, I thought.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
Does he stay with you here?
No!
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
31 people.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
Thank you.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancÃše?
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I have!
You have, yes.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
You got a .44 Magnum?
I got money.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
How much for everything.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Nah, this'll be fine.
Is there a firing range around?
Huh?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first.  You got anything to carry these in?
Nah. I ain't interested.
Who mam?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
You want to canvass?
Yes, mam.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
Why?
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
I don't know...
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Yes?
My name is Travis.
Thank you, Travis.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Where do you live?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
What kind of people?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
Really?
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said West 45th Street and conked out.
What did you do?
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
The moon?
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Huh?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
The DMZ?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
What hours do you work?
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
You must be rich.
It keeps ya busy.
You know what you remind me of?
What?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said Like a pusher
Oh. Who was that again?
The singer?
Kris Kristofferson.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
I bought a couple of tickets.
But this is a porno movie.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
Damn.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.
What do you mean?
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
This is sort of high class...
I mean porno movies.
My God!
We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty...
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Huh?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
I'm getting a taxi.
Keep it.
Hello, Travis.
Hello, Betsy.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Thank you, Travis.
Travis?
Yeah.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
You forgot sexy.
No, I didn't forget sexy.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
More people watch it.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Just what?
Kidding around... you know, fun.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
With who?
Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
Have you been noticing anything strange?
No, why?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
What taxi driver?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
How long has he been there?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
Try holding the match like this.
This I gotta see.
Oh, are you all right?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
Is he Italian?
You sure he's not Italian?
He's Black, OK?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Show me how he did that again.
What is it? I'm busy.
Just follow me.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
That's fine.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
The kind with a brush.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Yeah.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?
Well, I said, Lady
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
For a fee.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, Hey
And the kid says, Yeah. She's about 19
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
In the jungle. 122nd.
Huh?
Nah.  I suppose not.
20 bucks?
Hello.
You looking for some action?
Well... I guess so.
A girl needs protection.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your name?
That ain't much of a name.
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
Iris.
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
No.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
I don't remember.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do they drug you?
Oh, come off it, man.
Listen...
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
You can do it in my mouth.
Do you understand why I came here?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Don't you want to go?
I can leave anytime I want.
But that one night?
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
Well, I tried.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Can I see you again?
That's not hard to do.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Well, you want to or not?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Where?
Pittsburgh.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
God, you are square.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Who's a killer?
That fella Sport looks like a killer to me.
Huh?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He looks like a killer.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
He shoots dope too.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Why not?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Why?
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What's so important?
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You a narc?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
What should I do? Call the cops?
Cops don't do nothin.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I sure hate to go alone...
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
What do you mean?
My work may take me out of New York.
Why should it be grounded?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
No.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
Damn straight.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
No Sir.
Got your license?
Yes.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theatres for that.
I know. I tried that.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
We don't need any misfits around here, son.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
You want to work uptown nights?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
How's your driving record?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Physical? Criminal?
Age?
Twenty-six.
Some. Here and there.
Military record?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
You moonlightin?
No, I want long shifts.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
So I hear.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
Yes, Sir.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there.
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a K. K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Your name Sport?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Shit.
I'm no cop.
I'm hip.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
I'm here to see Iris.
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Get it.
Show it to me.
Travis.
Hey Wizard.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
What's the action around?
Slow.
Wiz?
Yeah?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Yeah?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Well, I just, you know...
Things got ya down?
Real down.
It happens.
I know.
Like do anything, you know.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
Neither do I, I guess.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Had a close one.
Not really.
Could we change the subject?
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the MonaLisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
Stick with Carla.
Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
Thank you.
I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, Bill
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
It's me sir.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
He's got a gun, sir.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I'm a field agent.
Tell me what you really do.
I don't understand....
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
Well yes I suppose ...
You suppose?
Yes.  You'll be outside.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THEPHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
Wait.  Where're you going?
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
Limp dick?
Wrong.
What, vou?
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
What are you doing?
Now they only have three rockets left.
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
Mason.  Mason?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of youranatomy ....
Surprise, surprise.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardoncontract you signed?
Womack ripped it up, right?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. Hollow.
Miss Hayworth?
Yes?
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Yes?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Cathy?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
It's a lovely garden.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
No. Just a few hours.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Actually, it's none of my business.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Yes.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
Lovebirds.
Thank you.
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
Yes, I did.
I was wondering...
Yes?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
Yes.
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Would you like some brandy?
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
All right.
Thank you.
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
San Francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
I suspected as much.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
When was this?
Different?
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
A trifle.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
And what had you done?
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Then why did she object to you?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
I see.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I did.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
And the second?
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Then go.
Is anyone there?
Look.
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
Cathy!
Yes, I did.
If your father were here...
No!
They're birds!
Your brother told me.
Oh, I suppose so.
I don't think your mother would like that.
I know.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Darling, of course I do!
I don't know yet.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Shhh. Shhhhh.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
The little Brenner girl.
It's Alice, ain't it?
It's Alice.
Good morning.
Morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Try my best.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Yep.
Do you know him?
Yep.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
Where?
See where I'm pointing?
Yes?
See them two big trees across there?
Yes?
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
I see. How do I get down there?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Mmmm.
It's a surprise, you see.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Where would I get a boat?
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Of course.
Thank you.
What name?
Daniels.
Okay.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Yep?
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl?
Yes.
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Are you sure?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
I need her exact name, you see.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Yes?
Thank you.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
How much for the phone calls?
It's nothing.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
We'll make our own fog.
They're back!
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
A what?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Oh. I see.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Lovebirds, I see.
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Yes, very.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes.
She was selling birds.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
I know, Mother.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Yes, Mother.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Mother?
Yes?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
Tell him about the party.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
I got them all, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
Where will we go?
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
I'm sorry, Mitch.
Mitch...
Shhh. Shhh.
Mother, get a rope!
Oh, my God, look at her!
Get a rope!
I can handle it.
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
You're doing fine.
I mean. I want to...
They're gone. The same pattern.
But they'll be back.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
They won't be.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
I started to say... inside...
You don't have to.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
No, not exactly.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Oh, thank you.
Where's Mitch?
Then he saw.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What good will they do?
Do you think Cathy's all right?
Cathy. At the school.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
No.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Yes.
I wish I could be that way.
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
I don't mind, really.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
That's the last of it.
And locked it.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Please.
We know what it is, Al.
Not by the thousands.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
These birds were...
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Does this room look silly?
He was killed last night. By birds.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes.
That's all right.
Monday?
Well, I...
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Sixty...  Oh.
Oh.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
I wonder if you could help me.
What?
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Lovebirds.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
I understand completely, sir.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
No, of course not.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Aren't these lovebirds?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Doesn't what make me...?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Are they moulting now?
How can you tell?
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
All right.  She smiles back.
What did you say?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam.
Hey, wait a minute!
I don't know you.
Ahhh, but I know you.
How?
We met in court.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
When?
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
What are you? A policeman?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
I think you're a louse.
I am.  Good day.  Madam.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
What made it...
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
So you're a lawyer.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
Criminal.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Only violators and practical jokers.
Ouch!
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
What for?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Why...
Yes?
Yes.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Oh, no you don't!
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Yes.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
You like me, huh?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
What did it say?
Can't see a thing.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Right next to the one you already had.
Look, Mr. Brenner...
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Yes, but...
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Seven o'clock then.
Maybe.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Famished.
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
Why did he shoot her?
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
His wife changed the channel.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Oh, yes.
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Yes.
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
So you didn't go to school together.
No.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
You were lying.
Yes, I was lying.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
I wrote the letter.
What did it say?
It said, Dear Mr. Brenner
Yes.
Why?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
I don't give a damn what you believe!
I'd still like to see you.
Why?
I think it could be fun.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
It is for me.
But not for me.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Here.  I have your money.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Cheers.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
You have a job?
I have several jobs.
I do different things on different days.
Like what?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Yes.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'm glad you do.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
What?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
What'll it say?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
No, tell me.
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Last night? What do you mean?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
No, I have my things in the car.
Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
No, thank you.
Some cream?
I'll get it.
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Are you staying?
I think I should, don't you?
It smelled of the fire.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Really? Tell me about it.
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
Certainly, of birds.
Growing a beard...
So they united.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. Why should humans rule? they asked themselves.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Hear, hear!
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
Take wing!
What it was, probably...
Mmm?
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
With my little sparrow leading team.
After the gulls attacked.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
Melanie, Melanie...
No, no...
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
Melanie...
...everything I know.
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
At Annie's house. She's all right.
I think it's safe to get out now.
We've got to get Cathy.
The town looks clear.
The bay doesn't.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
I keep thinking of Annie.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Have we still got power?
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
Maybe.
When will they stop?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
The power.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
No... wait.  Hold me.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
Hello, Miss Daniels.
What do you suppose it is?
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
You said three o'clock.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
And he'll talk?
Yes.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
Well, all right, but...
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
That... that... who was that?
Have you got a pencil?
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
Yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
How soon?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
These weren't a few birds.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
I don't know why.
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
I'm not sure, but...
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
With smoke.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
I'm Donald Fettes.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Mr. Gray?
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
I fear he may have to.
How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
Good.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
Good morning.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I'm only a student.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
Of course I will.
Yes.
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
You must leave this house.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
I'm cold as ice.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Aye.
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
I've heard of it.
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
Where can I find him?
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
Come in, boy -- come in.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Dr. MacFarlane --
Excuse me.
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
Well? And are you not a good student?
But Richardson?
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
I don't think I can go on, sir.
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
But this woman -- and her son --
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any subjects?
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Yes, I suppose so.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Well --
We can't be sure of that.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
I can't believe that.
Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
She's unconscious.
Pulse?
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
No.
What do you mean, Fettes?
What's that you say?
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
What?
See that, Fettes?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
You've no thought of going there?
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
No.
Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
It was a woman when we put her in.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
Not yet.
Why, yes.
Hear him?
An old acquaintance, eh?
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
I will not have you use that name to me.
You will not have it?
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
Afraid of what?
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
I am the best man for the job.
Why don't you do it then?
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
I'll not do it, Gray.
No.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
It might be an interesting case.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
Toddy hates me.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I've had some experience.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
The same. Look here, Gray --
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The heart pumps it.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Get out of here!
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
We have never been friends.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
I have other means of sustenance.
The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
But why, Gray? Why?
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
A pleasure to torment me?
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
What did you hear?
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
Now that is very interesting --  Take a chair, Joseph,
Only Brother.
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
You and I should work together.
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will Burke them,
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like.  Ah, how he cozened them.
Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest.
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they Burked them.
Was the paralysis immediate?
Any attacks of pain since?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
How long ago?
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Aye --
Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
Crony indeed!
You can get out.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You're not going to Gray.
He must leave me alone.
You've been with Gray again.
Aye.
Where are they?
Where are they? Last chance.
Was that it? Well, ok.
We won't.
Dream on.
Two down. Two to go.
The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.
You think I'm crazy.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
The strip joint?
Where is it? This place?
What? Call the police?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Think maybe knives do?
This is not just some thing. It's A C zero zero five.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
You killed her. I saw it.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What did they give you?
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
The scar.
I heard you were looking for this.
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
The scar. Which of you has it?
How can you die if you're already dead?
I was talking about you.
I was a friend of your sister's.
I know her friends.
That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
Yeah, no kidding.
Your father gave them to both of you.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
Someone else did it.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
He didn't kill her.
How do you know?
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
Daisy. How did you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Yeah, I know.
Are you ok?
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
No...
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
Erin. It's not your fault.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
No. You don't.
Yes I do, I really do.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
I don't want to see!
So you're going to kill him?
Have to find him first.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
My father.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
It's what Lauren would do.
It's ok, it's ok...
Erin. Who?
I don't know. I found him lying there.
Where are we going?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
... it connects you to me...
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Erin. I'll always be with you.
You mean Alex.
You killed my daughter.
I do. Every day.
Why are there so many?
Just hold on to me.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Honey. I just can't.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
Watch out!
What were you yelling about?
Are you ok?
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
What is it?
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
It still doesn't mean...
He said he'd prove it.
I think I dropped an earring.
Looks like you have them both on.
You're in with them.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
No.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
They killed her because she found out.
About you.
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
Sweetheart...
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
I don't believe you.
Please. Come inside.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
You wrote this?
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
That was my first question.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
Yes -- that is true.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Would you care to be more specific?
What I have to say must be said to all concerned.  It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
That's what I came to see you about.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
No -- not at all.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Such power exists?
I assure you such power exists.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Yes.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
That can easily be arranged.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
I think we've all been hearing too much about space men.
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Professor Barnhardt.
Of course, dear.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
What do you mean, dear?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
He gave these to you?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
No -- I'm afraid not.
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Where is that?
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Yes -- I think so.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Did all these people die in wars?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
All right.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Why not, Bobby?
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
We certainly did.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
I'll say goodnight again.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
Just Klaatu.
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
About five months -- your months.
About 250 million of your miles.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
I can judge only by what I see.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Well, we could--
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
It was a wonderful day.
You still haven't answered my question.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
Hello--
You ready?
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Is it real?
Looks real to me.
I wonder if we ought to--
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
Come on in.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
What about him?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
How do you know?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
Is that what you're thinking about?
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
I feel different right now.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
I don't know how to thank you.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Everyone seems so--
Jittery is the word.
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
You bring the cigarettes?
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Goodnight, my dear.
Oh -- hello--
May I see you for a minute?
May I walk out with you?
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
Yes--?
I want to know what he told you last night.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
What is it you want?
What time is it?
Just twelve.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Why not?
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
Where are you going now?
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Who?
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
Where is the meeting going to be?
At the ship.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: Klaatu barada nikto. Please repeat that.
Klaatu barada nikto.
Remember those words.
Hello.
I -- I thought you were--
I was.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
But how -- how long--?
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
No. That's all finished.
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
You sure about that?
No -- no, thanks.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
No -- I'm afraid not.
They would have killed this man?
How long will that take?
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
I don't like horror comics.
This one could save your life.
How do you like Santa Carla?
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
You better get some fresh air.
I don't like horror comics.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
All day.
Can't stand light?
Wears sunglasses in the house.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Yeah.
He's a vampire alright.
Why not?
You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
I'll have to drive!
We don't ride with vampires.
Fine!  Stay here!
Burn rubber does not mean warp speed!
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
They're gaining on us!
You gotta drive!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Time to activate Plan B.
What's Plan B?
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Should I run him through?
They're gonna book us.
Good.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Two down and two to go.
Whattaya mean?
You know what?  You're absolutely right.
Maximum body-count.
The meanest!
We still going?
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
I can't beat a Triumph.
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
We were gonna grab some food.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
What?...
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
Don't!  Stop!
Why?  They're only noodles.
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
What's goin' on, Marko?
Where is she?!
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
What is this, David?
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
Where you going?
For a ride.
With him?
Yeah.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
No.  Stick around.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
You can't kill me, Star.
I will, David!
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's dating one!
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From Vampires Everywhere...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a Guardian -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell -- are often employed for this purpose.'
How do you know they're not?
Hit the lights again.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Chill out Edgar.
What's that smell!?
Oh, no...
There's a cop behind us.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Of course not!
David.
I'll take you there.
I said, I'll take you there. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Sam, don't --
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the closet monster!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
I told Max eight o'clock.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
You have a T.V.?
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Good!
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
This is Michael.
No, Laddie.  It was a memory.
You didn't tell David?
I like Michael.
Still mad at me?
For what.
He looks dead.
He's just a deep sleeper.
He's not breathing, Mom.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I'll hitch.
Oh, no, you won't.
See you later.
No.  I'm up.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
Okay.
I was all of these.
No, he is here.  Shit...
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What else do you need?
Give me another one, please.
Sure.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
We are...
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
I'm tired now.
Mom... please.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Gotta go, Mom.
I didn't invite you in this time!
Get out, Mom!  Run!
We're getting close...
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Smells like something died.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
I thought we were poor.
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
You've heard this story before?
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Soon.
He met a girl.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Can we get a T.V.?
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Seriously?
You don't say. How real does it feel?
There are limits?
No need. I'll call again.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
Sam.  Is everything all right?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
In here?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
C'mere, Nanook.
Oh, no.  Now what?
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a mom!
Not funny, Sam!
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
But, Mom...
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Ohmygod...
Mom!
What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
... bottle ...
... head ...
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Do I look that needy?
Say hello to Thorn.
Hi, Thorn.
You're cute, Max.
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Boy!  Somebody areound here sure has bad breath!
Max!  What's wrong?
It's garlic!!  I like garlic, but...
I'm really sorry, Max.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
He doesn't walk all over me.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
I hope so.
Knight ...
... death ...
Something the matter?
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
Max... what are you talking about?
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Does it burn?
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
I am?
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
But you passed the test!
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
What?!  Did you know that!?
Are you following me?
Well, I...
Well... yeah.  Sure.
I just wanted to... I, uh...
Hi...
... power ...
What's your name?
Star.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
What do you mean?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I like Star.
Me, too.
I'm Michael.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Okay.
Ouch.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Now you and David...
Let's go see them.
No... no, everything's different now...
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
When?
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Okay.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Why not?
Then it's not too late for us...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I know, I've felt it...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
David's looking for me... I have to go.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Take laddie.
Save Laddie first.
... preserve...
... love...
... love ...
... love ...
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
They'll be coming for all of us.
It's gone.  I feel it!
So do I!
What!?  He can and I can't?!  No fair!!
This is kind of a cool place.
Will you give Mom a break?
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
Even poor people have T.V.s
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
You're beautiful.
Where are we going?
Nowhere.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Do I have to do this?
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Entertain yourself.
What did you do last night?  You look wasted.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What would that make Mom?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.
Mom's home?...
I'm making you a sandwich.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Piss off.
You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.
Michael?
Don't turn on the light.
Nanook...
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  He bit me!  This is my blood!
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
He was protecting you!
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
What about Mom?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
I don't know.
Star.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
The Marines.
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
What's the matter?
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Just listen.
Would that I could say the Same.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Let's load 'em.
I know.
Where these tracks headed?
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
Too damn dangerous.
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
How you doin', old boy?
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
What?
Have you come across Fuchs?
We'll see...
Cool it, Palmer!!
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Ain't it there?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Somebody broke in.
Now who'd go and do...
Childs!!
Let go of me...
We got to burn 'em.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Have we met?
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
If it did get to him.
Let's open it.
Hell no.
Let's open it.  Now...
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
You lying bastard...
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Clark, you come on out here!!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Promised? Who promised?
Cut him loose?
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
Torch it over there!
The dogs?
Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
MacReady!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Well, go on.
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
You buy any of this, Blair?
That's good enough.
Probably the next meal.
What we going to do?!
How the fuck do I know?!
Torch them!!
But...
He's gone already!  Do it!
Sir August...?  What now?
What do we do about those three?
MacReady!
What?
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
What are you doing?
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
What clothes?
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
We ain't buying that.
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
What for?
For your health.
You ain't tying me up.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Then kill me.
We should have jumped his ass.
Impossible?
Load of bullshit.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
Spaceship of some kind.
I think so.
What do you mean you think so?
Not the only one.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Neither will we.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Come on, Copper.
Hey, Sweden!!!
Anything?
What are you doing?
It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
I have an appointment.
Would that test have worked?
And if anyone tries to wake me...
I guess you're okay.
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Don't let up, Childs!
Quite a collection.
I am going after them.
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Little over two hours.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
What's...
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
Move it, Palmer.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Somebody definitely messed with it.
Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
I ain't going with Sanchez.
What kind of test?
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Tie up Clark, too.
He's dead.
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
This isn't a game.
Rules are made to be broken.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Just keep looking.
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
Everything that's been missing.
Anyplace but here.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Hmmm ...
Looks like rain, Steed...
The generator!
Calm down and get in your position.
Then we go after him.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Who else could have used that key?
What's happened?!
Yeah!
Well, let's get down there.
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
How curious ...
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
Ropes?
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
He tried to warn us ...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
After the cold war ...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
What are you trying to do to me?
We want to help...!
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
To you ... ?
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Who?
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
So am I.
Next assignment?
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Thank you, Steed.
Thanks, Valentine ...
You killed my husband.
Too many cooks --
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
But -- why?
I'm fine.
Then don't.
What about Starks?
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
Depends on what you're seeing.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
It's not my job to believe you.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
In where?
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
I'm already married ...
Relax.
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
We are not birds of a feather.
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our practices off to the New Year.
Temporarily.
And what's that?
Yes.
You killed him?
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
And what does that mean?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
Who are you?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
How...how are you here?
Valentine, listen to me ...
Ring?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
How?
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
I don't understand...
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
You may have known my father, William Starks.
He didn't either.
That's too bad.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
What should they be looking for?
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
Good.
This is really happening, isn't it?
[Beat] Thank you.
I need to get this letter to someone.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
The result would be ...
Then what's stopping you?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Why?
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
You two ok?
Our car won't start.
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
Jackie.
But I like it I guess.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Yeah.
You're just gonna walk?
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
What for?
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
I think I can remember what's on them.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
Well, you belong in one.
What are my choices?
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
[Beat] What?
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
[Beat] What?
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
I looked it up.
How?
I gave you my dog tags.
How'd he die?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
Please...
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
But no one knew until after...
After I...
[Beat] You bled to death.
What?
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
Do you really believe me?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
I know.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
I know.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Why?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
I might not be able to.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
Me, too.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
You're sure?
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
They're not.
[Beat, lost] No.
What? What are you thinking?
There're no cars on this street.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
[Beat] I don't know.
I was about to throw in the towel.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
1922. Why the kippers?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Whereas you are.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
And just what is the game?
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Much better.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Mother?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
To the hospital.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
What?
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
Then, where are you going?
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
I've been ok.
Good. How's your mom?
Ok, I guess.
Ok.
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
I think so.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
How you doin'?
I'm doing fine.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I don't understand.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
And if I didn't want to come?
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You were convicted of the crime.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
Why, what would you do?
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
So it's helping?
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
Believe me, I know.
My God you look exactly like him.
I never knew my father. Did you?
Why?
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
You thought my father was crazy?
What case?
How'd he get it?
[Beat] I don't know.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Exactly.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
[Beat] We will.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
I'll die either way.
What do you mean?
You have no idea what's going on.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
This has nothing to do with that.
My father always wanted a boy.
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Well, what time is it?
2004
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
It doesn't look all that different.
The future doesn't look different?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Maybe.
Why don't you help me?
Because I don't have time.
Why not?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
How...how do you know?
You told me this was how it happened.
I did?
Who...who kills me?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
What for?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
You still don't believe me, do you?
I do believe you...
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
He's having absence [pronounced absance] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
Who told you this?
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
You know how to get there?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Good.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
TV. Helps numb [makes a crazy gesture] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
Don't you go to jail for that?
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
What were you talking about the other day?
I wasn't talking about anything.
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
I thought we were on our way.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Or half cocked.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
It's gonna be sticky.
So what am I supposed to do?
You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
Geez, how's that for a fucking thank you?
Is it true?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
Becker does? Are you sure?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
No.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
Where are you going?
Sure.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Steed, we really must be --
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I don't think so.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Why of course?
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No.
No. [Beat] Not around here.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
No, I'm ok.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
Sure.
Thanks.
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
You like it?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
I don't know, but I think part of it's...
You don't think that's crazy?
This is a great song.
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
How?
I'm sorry.
That when you stopped being a nurse?
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
Do you really think so?
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Hon.
You want anything special for dinner?
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Go fuck yourself.
Who's the nut?
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Yes, sir.  I know.
We're both fine.
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
Hey.
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
No!
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
But why? What's the point?
And I suppose you're the knight.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
Oh, great.
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
No thanks.
I meant me.
Oh shit.
Stop.
I'm spinning.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
So how come you don't have any kids?
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
An eccentric recluse?
Thelma?  It's me.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
What did ya do?
You're a bank robber?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
How?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Tell me.
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
You're a little angle, you are.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Who's your friend?
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
I always knew that.
A regular outlaw.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
June, July ... August?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Any other vices?
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Where'd y'all go?
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
What the fuck is going on?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Do you love me?
Christ, sure... yes!
You're in Oklahoma?!
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Can't it go to any office?
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Okay.
Is that how you answer the phone?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Who did it?
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
And what's the mysterious code word?
What?
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Hey, peaches.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
Hello...
Who is it?
It's me.
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Maybe.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
It's nothin' like that.
Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever?  What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Maybe.
Will you at least see how it fits?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
I'm choking on it.
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Oh yeah.
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Strange.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
I wasn't about to.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
I might say the same.
In the back?
Am I in trouble?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
I'll call you right back.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Okay.  I will, too.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
In case of what?
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
Whose place is this again?
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Isn't this fun?
Thelma!
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Yeah!
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
Why should they think that?
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Maybe.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
Exactly.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Ready when you are.
Oh my God.
Get the car.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Get the car!
Shit!  I... I, which way?
West.  Left.
Louise.  Where are we going?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Which part?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
Yes.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
So this is all my fault, is it.
Now I become custody of police department?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
They won't until this is over.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Did you say formal? I must dress.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
What do you mean?
Why are you actin' like this?
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Give me the keys.
You're not touchin' that car.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
Did you finish thinking?
I think better when I drive.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
Call him?
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Will I be?
I don't know.  I won't be.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
It's probably not a good idea.
Louise.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
What did Darryl say?
I must say, you look more your old self --
You mean my other self ...
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
That's puttin' it mildly.
She thinks he's a pig.
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
Thelma kinda took to him.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
I heard that.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  Imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  He is a lucky man.
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
How do I look?
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Have another drink, Thelma.
What happened to your hair?
Nothing.  It got messed up.
What's wrong with you?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Taking a shower.
You left that guy alone in the room?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
How on earth can you tell?
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
No.
Drive!  Drive away!
What happened?
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Well, I just...
Holy shit.
Lemme see the map.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
You think you've found your calling?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
You're disturbed.
Yes!  I believe I am!
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Try to.
Litterbug.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Thelma.
Yeah.
What for?
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
It won't work.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Very good, Steed ...
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
What.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I... I...
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Louise?  Where are we?
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Now what?
Now what what?
Whaddo we do?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Yeah.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Before.
What little dogs?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Like a Chihuahua?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
This is so beautiful.
Gosh.  It sure is.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
Well, you got it now.
What on earth?
Any ideas?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
We should have just ignored him.
What?
Nothing.  It's not funny.
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
What?!
Harlan.
What?!  What about him?!
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Thelma!
Suck my dick... Boom!!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
About how fast was I going?
I am really sorry about this.
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
Shoot the radio!
Sorry!
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Ready?
Hit it.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
I believe you.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Yes.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Just asking.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
You do?
Yeah, you want it?
Yeah.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Are you alright?
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
You know why.  You already said.
What'd I say again?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
I said all that?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Louise?
Yes, Thelma?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
What do you mean?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
Thelma, that is not an option.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
But
He said they're charging us with murder.
Eeuww.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
No.
You awake?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Good.
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can change our names.
We can live in a hacienda.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It'd have to be pretty good.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
You're drivin'.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Pass him!
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
Does that mean suck my dick?
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
You know what's happened, don't you?
We've gone insane.
Yup.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
Not quite. This is my field.
Is there anything that isn't?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
How far are we from Mexico?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
How long do you think that'll take?
Shit!
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
Shit!
What?!
What?!  What d'you think?!
Oh.
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
Why?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You're crazy.
You're a good friend.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
How do you stay so positive?
Louise!
What?!
What in the hell is that up there?
Where?!
Way up ahead!
What in the hell is it?!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
It's grand!
God!  It looks like the Army!
Now what?
We're not giving up, Thelma.
What are you talkin' about?
Go.
Go?
Three agents killed by bad weather...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
You, too, sweetie, the best.
We been seein' you all along the way.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
You got that right.
Say you're sorry.
Are you going to apologize or not?
Hi!
We're fine!  How are you?
Where you goin'?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
Is that what you think?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Are you married?
Divorced.
Do you always drive this fast?
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
This must be the last straw.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Steed ... !
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Where am I?
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Was I?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
Orders.
To kill me?
Nothing personal.
I could save you the trouble.
No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Always.  Except ...
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
It wasn't me; you have my word.
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Is that all?
I can't take you to my place.
Somewhere else?
But you did suspect me.
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
Winning isn't everything.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
No, after you.
You lied.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
You'll find out.
Aren't you coming?
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
You didn't tell her?
Have we been invited?
What's that you're wearing?
It's called Black Leather.
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
So...the station is empty?
What is it?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Shall we?
Trubshaw again? What now?
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
Have a look at this.
I'll be back ...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
But --
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
The other thing is...
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Jesus...
We can't do that, Bobby.
Mrs. Peel?
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Something your father would've come up with.
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Smoke.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Have you any place in mind?
As a matter of fact I have ...
Yeah?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
What's it about?
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
Yes it is.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
The sun came up today.
It shouldn't have. But it did.
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Pity your mother came, too ...
Kids are supposed to get detention.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Forget it, Scotty.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Secretary of Defense...
Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
Hey, sport. You winning?
I, uh...
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
Back to work.
No you weren't.
Not as far as the election goes.
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
No.
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
No way.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
Damn right I'm scared.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
You're saying I have no choice.
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Hello?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
Where's Mother?
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Jesus Christ...
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Hey. Nice tie.
You're my hero, Carl.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
You don't believe him?
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
I see.
Mr. Clear Moon.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
It ain't Geronimo.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
Tell him, Ray.
an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
I see.
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Were you in Nam?
Six rounds. 357.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
This is a restricted area.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Peter's brother?  But --
Half-brother to be precise.
I did.
a fucking cop.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Beats the hell outta me.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
I already did.
Couldn't sleep.
How'd you know?
Cooch. You're my hero.
Who is he?
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
I know all this.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Surveillance? By whom?
Who's now vanished.
Makes two of us.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
Alright. Alright.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. What's the FBI really doing here. Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
I gave it back to her.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
When did we get that?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
I was getting to it.
Getting to what?
I fail to see --
Alright. Alright...
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
Cooch. Woh. Stop.
Yes.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Why?
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
if they mine uranium there; these people will have No place left to go...
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
No way, Cooch.
Let the press through.
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
After we've completed our investigation.
What are you --
Watch out!
What?!
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
well; maybe two seventeen.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
You've got no jurisdiction.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
his mother Never lived here. she was From up in North Dakota.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
His spiritual mother...
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Let's go.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
... and now?
Why does he wanna see me?
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
What did he say?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
He knows me?
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
What's he smoke in that?
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
He said he doesn't know.
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
What was he saying?
Why should I tell you.
Because he was talking to me.
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
He saw an owl.
So what?
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
Privately owned by ...
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
She's your sister?
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at hi
I don't see the connection.
The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
That's not solid.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
A what?
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
Ray --
No. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. but I put my ass on the line coming out here; man.
What'd you expect to hear?
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
It's not real.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Likewise.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
Global warming?
Still after Jimmy?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Crow Horse, listen --
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What do you mean?
Nothin'. Forget it.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Stop.
What's that?
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
So they took care of Leo.
Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
This Clear Moon's house?
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
Ray.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
He's gone.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
What about the water...
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
Some Indian time?
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
You didn't have another vision...
Oh, hello ...
Dead, I'm afraid.
You take care.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
That's right. Turn around.
This Jimmy's?
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Who did?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
Move it, Magdelana.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
What?
Great.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
How did you guess?
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
X22. Read.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
Never mind.
I read, Cooch.
Good.
X21. Come back.
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Mister Tully.
No. No, no. Thank you.
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
At Sioux Falls Pen?
Leavenworth a tough joint?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
Get up!
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
Weather's turning nasty.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
I know.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
They're not gonna send you right back.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
Think she really killed those agents?
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Amnesia?
Possibly. Split personality ...
Insane ... ?
Why?
She may try to kill you.
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
Anyone particular in mind?
You.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Impossible.
This man -- did you see him?
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
Guilty until proven innocent?
I was hoping you could tell me.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Where?
In your operation.
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
I think so, thank you so much ...
I feel sure of it.
She was ...
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Both, actually.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
Perish the thought.
I was at Harrow ...
What's wrong with this one?
Where's yours?
You got the job.
What to the rebels want?
The Last Resort.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
What happened to them?
Why not?
And you get a kickback.
Take me to the hotel.
What happened to number five?
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Shut up and drive!
But maybe you can change all that.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
What do you want?
Who are you?
How'd you find me?
Thank you.
Get it, please.
Thank you.
May I use your pen?
One shot -- for emergencies.
Rules are made to be broken.
I do.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
Fuck you.
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
So why am I still alive?
We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Who is it this time--my mother?
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Do you expect me to believe you?
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
I am Quaid.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
Did I? My mistake.
I know that.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Don't be an idiot.
What is it?
I'm with an very important client.
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Why not?
You are, and it's behind you.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Nice to meet you.
Eight years.
Hetero.
Brunette.
Sleazy...and demure.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Amazing.  Where are we?
At Rekall.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? She's real because you dreamed her?
That's right.
You open it.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Suppose I do...then what?
What is it?
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
Relax, you'll live longer.
Is he your boyfriend?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Where's Kuato?
Yeah.
What, aliens?
I don't know.
You're Kuato, right?
C'mon!
Melina!
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
Rekall?
Oh, Rekall.
Yeah.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Well don't.
Why not?
A friend of mine tried one of their special offers...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
Hey, Quaid!
Harry!
What trip?
I did?
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
What are you, my father?
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Harry, what the hell is this?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Quit while you're ahead.
Is that better?
Mmmm.....
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
Who?
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Who is she?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
I don't know.
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
But I'm always home by morning.
Let me go!
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
...You mean it?
You know I do.
Lori...
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Do what?
Move to Mars.
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Just think about it.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
And you believe him?
All right, forget about it.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Lori, move.
I'm late.
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Bye.
What are you doing?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Harry from work...He was the boss.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would spies want to kill you?
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
Let me finish!
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
I got a trip to Mars.
Oh God, Doug.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
They did!  But I killed them!
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
Doug...
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
I'm not your wife.
The hell you're not.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
It was implanted by the Agency.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Beats me.  I just work here.
I'm honored.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
It's time you found out.
Clever girl.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Yeah.  Some of it was fun.
I suppose you're not here either.
I'm here at Rekall.
I love you.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Doug, don't!
Nice to meet you.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Mars.
Right.  Mars.
That a problem?
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
What's in the two week package?
How real does it seem?
As real as any memory in your head.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics.
All right.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
No options.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an Ego Trip.
I'm not interested in that.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Secret agent...How much is that?
Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
What's he talking about?
I love you.
I love you.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
Blondes.
I guess he didn't.
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
...What?
There's something I have to tell you...
I don't remember you.
What are you talking about?
I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Hauser left me a note.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Not any more.
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
She wasn't really my wife.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Why would I lie to you?
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Don't be ridiculous.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Inside what?
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Get out!
I thought you didn't like me.
So you dropped by to apologize?
Now what?
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
I used to model for 'em, why?
Just wondering.
Not bad, for a hooker.
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
I saw them.
Oh, since when?
You two-faced-bastard.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
Where are you going?!
The reactor.
People are dying, Quaid!!  Stop!!  We've got to get air!!
Where's this reactor come from?
Aliens built it.
Aliens?!
You sure about this?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
Enough for everybody to breathe?
What's wrong?
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
Wait!
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
Ready as we'll ever be.
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
You can't fight'em that way...
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
What the hell is that, anyway?
What do you use it for?
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find me.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  History.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.
You know, up the jeep trail.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Oh my God.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
We're not going over there, right?
No.  We go straight.
So...now what?
Nope, there!  That's one.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
You didn't cook breakfast?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Has a lot of rain.
Do not talk to the driver.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Why?
Well, sure.
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
You gotta ask that?
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get really serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
Well, you're the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
That's the plan.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
So long, cactus!
Adios, bridge!
Jeez, look at that guy.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he wanted to kill himself?
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
I'll go with that plan.
Oh, Jesus!!
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!!
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Those assholes are supposed to be fixing the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
Val!  Val!
You're hung up again.
I am not!
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Screw you.  For all you know they could fly.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Great.  Thank you.
Here's the plan...We don't even stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
That is the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Why would they do it?
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
Oh shit!
What the hell are they?
This is one big mother!
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of anything like this before?
Pham Van don't get his mitts on this for no measly fifteen bucks!
You got that right!
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
We'll take your word for it.
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Prairie dog burrow...
Little sons of bitches.
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a goddamned bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Me, too.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Don't he have a home to go to?
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
You go north, I'll go south.
Right.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna help you.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
How the hell long it take you to change a tire?
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
We need another plan.
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Its tires are flat...
Well...all right!  We just roll on out of here!
We got a plan!
I'm making the run to the Cat.
I'm best at driving the Cat.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Use the fucking bomb!
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
I want to live for the three days.
What the hell are you doing?!!
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Not yet, not yet...
Road's in!
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in People magazine...
People?  Hell, National Geographic.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Yeah...but no ties.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
What?
She likes both of us.  We both helped her out.
You are so full of shit...
Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
You better get packed.
Right.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
Could be.
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Twenty.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Yeah, geography.
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as weird vibes.  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Darn it!
You okay?
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Think it's still following us?
Let's assume that it is.
Ready?
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
It does.
Why do you all keep asking me?
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be some way!
Like what?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
Good point.
It worked!  There they go!
LET'S DO IT!
Do you have coffee?
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
No... No, go away.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Get lost Bobby.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
I'm nearly out.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Don't be late.
Here he comes.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
You killed Mike.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Don't get funny with me again.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
Bobby...
Bobby's got it.
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be Federal. With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Did she have someone with her?
Was there an argument?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Is there a golf course around here?
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
No you couldn't.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
Yes...
OK, Gordon.
OK, Gordon.
Okay, Gordon!!!
Smell something fishy, huh?
Congratulations. I heard about that.
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
What are you doing?
Pouring it out!
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.
No, sir, we did not.
Where's Hap?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Any friends?
Ever see her with someone else?
Did she ever mention any friends?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
What happened to her?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
Thanks.
What do you mean?
Thanks.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Sort of shorthand.
Shorthand. Really?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
How do you figure?
I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
What do you mean?
Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
A blue rose.
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
It must be a high priority situation.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
That's what I heard.
That's good.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
I don't know, Sam.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
Cole said she was 17.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
Oh.
Accidental?
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
What is it?
It is a piece of paper with the letter T imprinted on it. Take a look.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
Agent Desmond, it's...
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She lived alone.
She must have known someone.
I'll get my kit.
She's wearing a ring.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Yes, he is like a clown.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Faulty wiring.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
You didn't do your homework?
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Thanks.
James called me last night looking for you.
When?
He probably wanted to drive over.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Are you going to tell him about that someone else?
I don't know what to do.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Oh god, Laura.
Well, why not?
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that lasting love... true love.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Donna, are you my best friend?
Of course...
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
No, I want to smoke.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
You want a muffin?
Goodbye, Muffin.
Where are you going?
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Where are the Cookies?
Dancing.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
Nothing.
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
Not you, Donna, not you.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
No, you should forget about last night.
Laura, I am your friend.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
You're not mad at me?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
What can I tell you?
How did the car get back here?
WE got it back, that's all.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
I can't help you there.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
But I love you, Laura.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Cause I like it.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Bob.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Bob is real. He's been having me since I was 12.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
Oh, yes... yes...
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I'm not.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Hey, Jacques...
I am The Muffin.
What? She asked about my father?
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Let's go all the way.
James...
Okay.
Laura, do you love me?
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
James...
When am I going to see you?
I've got to see you.
Not now.
This afternoon?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
What about tonight?
I can't tonight.
What's going on?
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
What the hell is wrong with you?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What do you mean?
You know it and I know it.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
Oh, Laura...
You always hurt the ones you love.
You mean the ones you pity.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
What?
When he finds out.
Bobby killed a guy.
You want to see...
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
Boating?
Eating?
They were looking for wood.
Can I take the car?
I forgot my books at school.
What?
What were you doing in my room?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Mom... what are you wearing?
Mom, take it easy.
I hate asparagus.
Where's Dad?
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Good night, Mom.
Dad.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, Hello
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
Fine.
School?
...school's fine...
Not really.
Dad...
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
Who was that?
A special friend?
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
No.
We're late to get to your mother.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes.
Dad?
Did you come home during the day last week?
No.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
Stay away from me.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
I always thought you knew it was me.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  I'm hungry.
Look at this finger here.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Daphne, I...
Did you get this from your lover?
Bobby didn't give you this?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
Who am I?
That's right.
Nothing, I chickened out.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Go on.
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
But I think I know where she'll be....
Is that it over there?
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
It hit sideways and skidded in.
You seem to know a lot about him.
Did it do you any good?
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
Aw, he isn't that good...!
I do know him...slightly.
What's he like?
Like...ah...
I didn't know how to stop you...!
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
They've all stopped at the same time.
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
How does it happen cars are running?
The troops are certainly moving in here!
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
Would you like some coffee, General?
Can you handle one of these?
Sure...get in!
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
Is that... machine...?
It's gone now.
Where are we?
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
I liked him.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
How long was I out?
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
Nothing there now.
It was...  ...one of them!
What was it like?
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
They've blocked it!
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
How'd you guess?
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
Don't let's lose each other.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you.
Right.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
It was nearer than that.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
They don't do much of anything...!
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Can I read it?
You mean that was a...
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
So I don't know about horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
What?
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
Like weird calls, by any chance?
Chase...
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
One of mom's cups got broken.
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
No, you don't.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
What if it isn't over?
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Guess so.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Heather?
Chase, you'd better come home.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
He's had some sort of...episode.
What?  What kind of episode?
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Like what?
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been another call?
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
I'll be there in three hours.
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
No.
No...
Like what?
Oh my God...
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Doctor...
He was just here!
Everything is not fine!
DO you mind...
I want my kid out of here now!
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
no.
You have a fever, sweetie?
You going away?
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
Someone's coming.
What?
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
Bye.
Rex saved me.
Rex?  Who's Rex?
Finish, please!
Time for sleep.
Say how they find their way back home.
Tomorrow night.
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe.
Who?
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
He's on his way.
Right.
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
Not sleepy.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
In my bed.
Your bed?
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Do you have to die to see God?
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Home.
You okay, champ?
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
Right 'cross the freeway.
That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Coming for you...
Dylan, where's the man?
Here.
What...what is that?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Read me some?
I'm fine.
In what, a romantic comedy?
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Yeah...how'd you know?
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
When do you think it'll be done?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
I've never mentioned it to him.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Really?
You really think Dylan's okay?
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
I know how Chase really died.
Fred Krueger did it.
I want to see the body.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I just can't.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
What's that?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
Captured?  How?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Me?  Why me?
That was Nancy, not me!
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
Choice?  What kind of choice?
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
No, not really.  I...
My child?  No...but...
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Robert?  I...
Yes?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Uh...sure...when?
Now?
Coffee'd be nice.
Black's fine.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
A cop?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Why? He's right in the groove.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
What's Cao Ben?
Twenty.
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
I don't mean your head head - I'm not gonna piss on your head - your hair an' all... Just piss in the toilet. Y'all take a listen - here a deep sound comin' down from Bobby Peru.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Get out.
Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?...  Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.
No way... GET OUT!!!
Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say fuck me soft - then I'll leave. Say fuck me... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it...
Whisper it... Whisper fuck me... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Fuck me.
Someday honey, I will... But I have to be goin' now... Conta i no joras...
I'm from all over.
You was in the Marines, huh?
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
How 'bout a beer?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No, haven't heard of it.
This your car?
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Sorry to hear it.
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
You black?
You an indian?
No.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
What's that?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
No... I don't think so, man.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Whattaya mean family?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
When did you talk to Lula?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
She really say she was pregnant?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Have now.
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
Forty bucks...
This is easy money, pardner... No ones gonna get hurt in this thing... And I don't think you can afford not to take it... I'll be bringin' the Eldo 'round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin'... If you ain't a pussy - you'll be there.
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
Yeah... yeah... I guess so... That kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
What's she doin' here?
Why should it?
That's right... Take one of these.
What is it?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
No shit?!?! You know him?
What'd you say?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
What's the name of it?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
It was my decision, not his.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Set one up.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
No sir...
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
Whattaya do there?
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
So, it's back to the islands.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
What happened on the charges?
The Good Witch...
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
But I'm wild at heart.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
Come here.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
In what capacity?
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
I couldn't say, which one?
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Hasta siempre.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
What?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
That bastard Pucinski...
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
You won't of missed much.
See ya downstairs.
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Why, honey?
Hey baby...
Peanut...
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at The Hurricane.
Stab it and steer.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
You're perfect for me, too.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
Didn't he say somethin'?
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
No, he picked me up.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
And you never told nobody about it?
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
Here she goes again...
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
What's that honey?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
Sailor?
Yeah?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
She got me an abortion...
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
What happened to him?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
What's that, peanut?
Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin' a hard lesson. What I learned from observin' Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He'd startin' behavin' weird? Like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'?
Actin' funny how?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
Hell, peanut...
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would give him peace of mind. Nobody's seen him since.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
What's that?
So?
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Yeah, maybe...
Sailor!
You up for that?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital O. I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
You mean like pedal pushers?
I guess.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
That don't smell like a More.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
They sure do stink.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Got anyplace special in mind?
We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Come look at this.
What's that, honey?
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
It's just another case, Sailor.
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
You got me, peanut.
You certain?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
I do.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
What was this one?
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who do?
You do.
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Where?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
You think he saw us?
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
You ready for this?
Uh huh.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Yeah.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
You think she's pretty?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
More'n likely.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Who do you think, Chief?!
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Told you not to call your mama.
How much we got left, honey?
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
That'd be good, Lula.
What's that, peanut?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
You knew my daddy?
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
Oh shit...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
How'd you know my daddy?
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
Lula, you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
You upset with me?
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
They have, sugar.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
It's a comfortin' idea.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
If you say so.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
What's that?
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
Oh God, Sailor.
One bad car accident...
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
You think she's gonna make it?
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
I'm afraid she is, baby.
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
No radio or TV...
And no AC.
Now what?
Yeah?
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
That you, Sail, honey?
The only one.
You find any work?
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Come sit by me.
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
I'll come along.
Anything I can do for you?
Sailor? You know what?
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
It's okay by me, peanut.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
And Bobby too, I hear...
You talk to 'im some?...
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
Oughta make 'em happy.
So where'd you say you was?
Went with Bobby.
Sail?
Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
That was in Vietnam.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
Shake hands with your daddy.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
Lead the way.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
How can you say that, Sailor?
What makes sense, is all.
LULA!!!!
I'll bet.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Mama???
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Like hell.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Just a place.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Six.
Got any plans?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Wouldn't make any difference.
What if I told you not to?
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
Oh God! What does that mean?
I knew you'd want it again...
That's not why I called.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Santos... It isn't.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Take care of him?
Yes.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Get rid of him?
Yes... Get rid of him.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Just tell me what you want.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
You need to explain it.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Simple? Kill him? How?
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Santos...
Shoot him.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Yes.
Where? In the leg?
No.
Where?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Yes.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Through the forehead?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
On one condition...
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
Santos... I can't...
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Put your shoulders back.
What?
You got nice tits.
Someone's gonna see us.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
No...
My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Where we goin'?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
What?...
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
No.
Well, she wants to fuck you.
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Whattya mean?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
You heard right.
Life is unpredictable.
I didn't see nothin'...
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Well?...
Thanks...
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
No!  Nothing happened.
Chief - mind if I take her?
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
No.  I need a drink.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
End my career?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
We're gonna be okay, man...
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Where're you?
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
-- Knock it off!
How you guys doing?
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Okay so far.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Hey, you okay?
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
I'm taking you back out.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Your rig?
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
I'm switching off now.
Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
Not for long.
You never did like being called that, did you?
Who else?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
You wanna know what I think?
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
That must be it.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
I haven't worn mine in months.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
So what about Michael then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Fine.  Be that way.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
No.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
But what did he see that made him panic?
What do you think he saw?
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Cute, Virgil.
What's the scoop, ace?
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
Need some help?
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
What about O-2?
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
Jesus, Lindsey--
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
No.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
You dumb jarhead motherf--
He's got the shakes?
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
I think it likes you.
It's trying to communicate.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
He's jammed the mechanism.
Now what?
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Is he...
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Not in this thing.
You totaled it, huh?
Yeah.  So sue me.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
You noticed.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
Well, that's that.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
They'll come out after us.
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
You see where it's coming in?
Calm down, Bud.
Did you do it for Tim?
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
I don't know how!
We've only got one suit.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
Alright, put this on.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
FUCK LOGIC!!
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
It is insane.
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Oh God, Lins... I--
Tell me later.
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Hi, lady.
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Who then?
Hello, Brigman.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Yeah, right.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Just come down, John. Just --
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Let's go, guys.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Did you find Wilhite?
God, I hate that bitch.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
What's the matter with you?
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Why bring it here?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
Is that it?  Is this right?
All right.  Do it!
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
He's convulsing!
'Fish'?
Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
It doesn't go like that.
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
You better not say you missed that.
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Copy that.
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Not likely.
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
Been ripping off fire stations?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
What kind of light?
Would we see the flash?
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
What, you've never seen one before?
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
That was never proved.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Yeah.
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
Thanks for the speakers.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Ya love it, probie?
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Goddamn it Stephen!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Thanks.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
Why?
She'd punish me.
No.
Who?
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
This?
Yeah... too bright...
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Agnes...
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Because...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
Why?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Agnes...
Who tells you these things?
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
That's not what he meant.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Who?
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
But she watches... she listens.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
No I don't... the host is enough.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Of God.
Why?
I don't know.
Dear Jesus...
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Yes Mother.
Why?
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
It made them holy.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
No.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
I burnt them.
Why?
They were stained.
Yes, Mother.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
It's not that... it's not that...
What do you mean?
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
For what?
I don't know... I don't know...
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Yes.
You have a lovely voice.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
Yes.
First thing that comes to your mind?
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Love.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Who?
Everyone.
Well, who in particular?
Uh huh.
I love you.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Yes.
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, yes!
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, I know he does.
He's told you?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
You've been alone together?
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
In the confessional.
What, are you kidding? By myself?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Why should they?
I don't know.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
And what did you do?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
I fell asleep.
Yes.
What baby?
From their heads...
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
From God.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Then let's talk about something else...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Agnes...
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything.
What's your real name?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
No.
Would you like some?
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
No questions.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
One.
What?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
Why should I?
I don't know.
You liked Sister Paul?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
What else did she tell you?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
You have trouble sleeping?
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
What things?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
How did she know that?
Somebody told her.
Who?
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Did your mother see angels often?
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
No, but I can never tell her that.
She'd get angry.
Yes.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Like you?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
A mistake...
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Is that what she said?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Not my fault.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
I was a mistake.
Everything... I don't have children.
Agnes...
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Roll the hose.
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
I'm not sick.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
And you're unhappy.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Agnes...
Answer me!  You never answer me.
What did you do?
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
I breathed!
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
No...
You can tell me.
I can't.
She's dead isn't she?
Yes.
She can.
How?
She...
... makes me...
Yes?
She tells you you're ugly?
Yes.
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
Why?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
How does she know that?
Her headaches.
And then...
What?
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Alright.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
No I'm not.
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
You're a mistake.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
I really love you.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
As much as God loves you.
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Yes.
Who am I?
Doctor Livingston.
And why am I here?
To help me.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Because I'm in trouble.
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
I'm frightened.
Of what?
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
How did you have a baby?
Yes.
Did you want it to come out?
No.
Why?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Yes.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
It grew.
What made it grow?  Do you know?
No.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
She made me promise not to.
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
I'm afraid.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
I ate.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
I hate them.
And then what happened?
Hm hmm.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
What is it?
Someone's following me.
Who?
Sister Marguerite I think.
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
What else?
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
A wastepaper basket.
What do you think it's there for?
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
Yes.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you do?
I have to throw up...
Ready?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
I don't know which one
Of what?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
No... don't hit me please...
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Frightened.
Do you remember what just happened?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Agnes, can you hear me?
Yes.
I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
She said Michael.
What did she mean?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
And the passage to the barn?
Yes.
Why?
So I could go to him.
Him.
How did she know about him?
She'd seen him too.
Where?
Are you frightened?
Yes.
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
Agnes... Agnes...
Stay away from me...
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
No...
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
For what he made me go through.
I hate him.
Agnes, who did this to you?
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
It was dead.
It was alive wasn't it?
I don't remember.
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
What did you do?
I put her to sleep.
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
What?
Sister...
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Why?
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Larry...
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Something they... that they overlooked.
I don't know.
Larry...
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Thanks.
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Brian, look --
What about Roger? He's free.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
All I want is one more week.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I'll have it.
Next week.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
It's your favourite...
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
How do you survive?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
The one up on the third floor?
Uh huh.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
What does this have to do with..?
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
...Not now, Brian.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Fuck you.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
Yes... I...
You can call me Sister.
... Thank you.
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
You were a smoker?
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
No-one.
Yes.
How did she hide it during the day?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
What's his name?
Could there have been anyone else?
Obviously there was.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Why haven't you asked her?
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Why do you think that?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
The science of psychiatry.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
I am not with the Inquisition.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
That's ridiculous...
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
And in your eyes?
I've already told you what I thought.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
It's possible isn't it?
Who?
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
That possibility never occurred to you?
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
Shortly after she came to us.
And you weren't shocked?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
And what happened?
She stopped eating completely...
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
She has it now.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
Not simple, no.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
You hate us don't you?
What?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
The Catholic Church...
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
Hey, what are you doing here?
So hello.
It's my affair too.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
I'm only interested...
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
She is not a child.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
???
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.
Then help her.
I am...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
There's another choice.
What?
Aquittal.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
All right, what do you need.
Answers.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, some time in January.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Visitors to the convent.
Nothing.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Yes.
Take at look at it.
There's nothing here.
Oh, Dear God...
The sheets...
What sheets?
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
When was that?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Sister Paul?
You lied to me
About what?
Your niece!
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
And Agnes' father?
Like keeping her home from school?
Listening to angels?
I don't think I care to know.
She molested her!
Oh, dear God.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
Because I didn't know...
Oh, God.
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
You're selling dad's boat?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
And my permission?
I'd like yours too.
We'll see about that.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
I know you don't.
An unhappy woman...
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
Because I am a moral person.
Bullshit!
Bullshit yourself!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
You just said...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Nothing...
What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Would you like one?  Huh?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice.
All right?
Fine thanks...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Long, thin and filtered.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course
Hand rolled.
Even Christ would partake socially.
Saint Peter?
Pipe!
Right...
Mary Magdelen?
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Do you think they ever existed?
Become?  One is born a saint.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Would it stop you if I did?
No.
May I be present?
Of course.
Then let's begin.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
You're what?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For the Church?
For Agnes.
You think she's a saint?
She's been touched by God, yes.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
The father!
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
How  ?
Don't be ridiculous.
Well give me a reasonable explanation
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
This is insane.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
But how did it happen?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
She is an innocent.
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
Somebody told her.
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Why would I lie?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Hasn't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
My God, but you're determined.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Is it because she's a nun?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Yes.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
I didn't guess until it was too late.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
The baby?
The scandal...
You went to the room to help with the birth.
She didn't want any help.
You wanted that child out of the way.
That's a lie.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
And the baby.
No!
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Before or after you killed the child?
I left it with her and I went for help.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
That's enough.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
What happened to the baby?
Wasn't it!
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
I saw it.
Saw what?
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Everybody did.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
What are you doing here?
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
What were they doing there?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Brian.
Jennifer.
You look great.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Huh.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
With grenadine, right?
When I was twenty.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
I'm gonna propose.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Yeah...
Arson.
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
I could use a date.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Hi.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
Okay.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Thanks for the invite.
Got anything to drink in there?
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
A timer.
Homey.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Then why did you quit?
I wanted to be a good one.
Brian. What's wrong?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
I work for the city.
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Hi.
Hi.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
I don't know anything about it.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Yes.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
What is --
Just take it.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
What'll you do?
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
It's a small town.
Hey, do I know you?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Who's doing this?
Then who --
Any I.D.?
What?
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
The outlets.
Trychticholorate.
Who the fuck is doing this?
Oh Jesus Christ...
I want another shot, Sir.
I need another one, sir.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
See you Monday. Sir.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Are you still here?
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
Pest control.
Shhh.
What are you listening to?
Glass?
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Another backdraft.
It's okay.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
Read.
Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --
Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium.
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
And the putty around the door?
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
I don't guess.
I don't work for them, either.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
What?
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.
But he killed these guys.
What reason?
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Are you going public with this?
No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Fire.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Nice bunch of guys.
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Only one guys checked in?
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Yeah? Airtight?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Then who wrote the report?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
How ya feeling?
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
No.
Just wondering.
So what do you want me to do?
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Your brother was a good man.
Yeah.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Like it never happened...
Brian?
You look like... Brian.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Four months.
Four months?
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Yeah. Big fan.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Every little boy's fantasy.
I have a job.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Nice boat.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Completely out of control.
Engine 115, right?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Backdraft.
Do you have to do that?
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
What?
Swayzak's not my boss.
It's in my blood, Willy.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Management were pin heads.
Coffee sucked.
I was ahead of my time.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
And DIE!
Fireman shit?
Firehouse.
Dad!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--mine's better--
--no way--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
Yeah?
Fuck you, Carl.
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
I was sure trying.
All right, what do we know?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb--  --listen, that was a Watergate question--
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
--what do you think?--
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
a spy; you mean?
It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
We need a sympathetic face.
July of '71.
About the past year.
That was fun.  What now?
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
And you haven't called him?--
What's that?
The fucking New York Times.
Goddamnit--
--see?--
--I'm trying--
--fifteen phone calls--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Why didn't we get that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
I'm busy.
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
See her?  Get anything?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
she was panicked; Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate; you could tell.
Were you eyebrow reading?
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
Who's first?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
You're not a kid anymore.
My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, My God
I never scared anyone before.
Facts or theory?
Anything you've got.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
We understand your problem--
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
We appreciate your position--really.
And I'm a Republican.
Republican?
Sure.
When?
Nixon.
Did he just say what I think he said?
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
she was really paranoid; the bookkeeper.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
I'll be there.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
You want me to be the bastard.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--there had to be a White House overseer--
Colson.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
Goddamnit--
--shit--
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know, I know--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--has he got an ax?--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
--I haven't said anything--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the
How high up, which Republicans?
Haldeman I know; who else?
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, No
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
What would you have done?
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
He'll give us a sworn statement.
We're inside the White House now.
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
--we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.
I think that's him.
Who?
Nah.  Maybe.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
What's the matter?
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
Maybe we are...
--Jesus--
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
Woodward?
Hmm?
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
Only everything...
You overslept?
Goddamnit!--
You can't talk about my brother like that...
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
0.479166666666667
Night.
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
I'm on deadline.
Whatever.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
yeah; that was in the Times this morning.
This?  Naw...
Howard Hunt?
Any idea what he did?
Teddy Kennedy?
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Fixing my roof.
It's not your roof anymore.
Donald Segretti?
That's right.
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
Mind if I try?
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
I've got a lot of energy.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
By they you mean...?
By they you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
When did he hire you?
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Tell that to Muskie.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
I didn't.
But you know who did.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
Sure--off the record.
On the orders of Haldeman?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
Can't help you.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
so?
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--that was awhile ago--
--I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto. That was your spiel then. The Lifestyles of Deserters.  I'm still waiting for it.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
--you got more than one source?--
--yes--
Where's Sean?
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
you remember.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
He treats you okay?
Okay.
I treated you better.
You treated me like shit.
We've just been talking to Young--
he was going to Go into law practice with Segretti.
And?--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
What's a real denial?
--what?--
if he did it or just said he did it; God knows.
Absolutely--
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See?
You want some coffee?
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
He's out.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Yeah? When was the last time?
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Five hundred; six maybe.
It's right under that pile.
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
FBI too?
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
Hey, easy...
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
One minute but then--
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
...No... never in so many words...
It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
Which people?
Who were they?
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
What's wrong?
I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
No games, Irwin; give.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Who by?
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
To cover up?
But they both worked at the White House?
Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
Right.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
What happens when the baby comes?
--this'll only take one second--
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
You asking me to disclose my source?
Look, I'm sorry I --
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
I don't know titles.
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
OK.
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, I'm not here
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
you have nothing more to say; I understand that.
Putty? On both doors?
What I don't understand is how you got here.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
Yes, sir.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
To where?
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Ratfucking.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Mitchell knew then.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Haldeman too?
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
Talk about Segretti--
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
There were more then.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
How grand?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by s
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
--I'm Woodward.
I think so.
No.
It may never come out.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
I couldn't say.
It is.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
Nobody ever had too much.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
...go on, go on...
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt?  It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans.
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
I did all right on McCord.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
You can't believe that.
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
What'd you get on W.House?
Lotsa hints--
Who's Charles Colson?
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too
Who's Colson, Harry?
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
So?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
--who you got?--
--well, Sloan--
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
Could develop.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He works for me.
You like everybody, Ronald.
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: anyone but Bernstein.  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
Howard--
That was awhile ago.
I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--maybe I'm tense--
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of
Absolutely.
--no--
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
You don't know him.
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
He just did.
Mr. Sloan?
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
Does they mean the White House?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five.
Haldeman.  Right?
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Go on.
look; when the Watergate Grand Jury questioned you; did you name names?
Knock it off. Now.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
And the world -- the whole world.
Got a cause?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
I'm working on it.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
What do you listen to, Stephen?
I might.
It knows us. This one knows us.
I need that report, Lt.
Alderman Swayzak.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Alderman.
Don?
No Marty, I don't.
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Did you tell him you did?
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
No it isn't! You're dead!
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
Ha-ha!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
Salots! Shitfucker!
What?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Uh-huh. Good for you.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Like an underground club?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Come on. I'm from New York - the shoot me state. Don't wait up.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Andy!
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Andy! Holy shit!
Serafine...?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
So... you feel okay now?
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
What about your glasses?
It's okay. I can see fine.
Don't you want to change?
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
A la votre.
This looks familiar...
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Serafine...
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Hello?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I know. He told me.
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Andy! No!
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
A cure?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I don't know...
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
They're coming!
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Are you crazy!?
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
What the fuck!? You too!?
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Yeah. French fries...
Holy mother of God...
Fuck me...
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
What...?
We don't both have to die.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
I know where he'll go.
Where?
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
Didn't even have to ask.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
No wonder he let her go.
God. I can't believe it.
What?
It's making me hungry.
Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead.
What are you saying?
Whoa...
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Well, they are French.
Right.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Okay. Be careful.
You too.
Oh God. Shit...
Andy...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
No... I...
Shit!
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Or else what? You'll kill me?
You'll never get the chance.
Claude...?
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Sure. Don't you?
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
Looks like he lied to you too.
What?!
Oh shit... No...
Oh no... no....
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
What about me?
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
What?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or Daydream. It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Andy...
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Not you too -
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed.  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Uncle Terrence.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Because Gaston was after it.
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
I told him it wasn't ready...
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
Sort of...
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Where is it! Please!
Claude.
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Jesus...
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his hippie brother. Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
What do you mean, maniacs?
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Why would he pick this one?
Not that I know.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Alright. Let me write a letter.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Shit. I feel sick.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
You fucking liar!
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite intense. So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. The great cure for lycanthropy! Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
You know what that is, right?
No, what is it?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
I don't even watch TV.
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
What would you call her?
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
I'll come with you.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
Stay here.
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
Needs patching.
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
Wait 'til I'm across!
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
Avalanche season is coming.
I'll get you there all right.
Let's go.
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
I just want this over with.
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
...I won't let a killer walk!
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
Your infrared camera?
Keep back.
You goin' to the escort service?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
How long have you been up north?
Can't be.  Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
Had?
She's dead.
How did she..?
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
You should know something.
I was hoping you had some news --
-- Corbett's a killer.
The radio's on the fritz.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Why?
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Stay here.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
Thanks.
I bet you haven't had lunch.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
Did you catch Corbett?
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
Was there any trouble?
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
That's not what I meant.
It's exactly what you meant.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Permanently?
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Wait a second.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
That's my line.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
What's going on?
I'll tell you everything later.
Where's Corbett?
So what's the problem?
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
I'm staying.
You're hurt.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
My home is here.  With you.
Leave it here.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
Ben Corbett?
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
Desmond.
New to the country, kid?
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
Does he have people?
Send him down to her.  There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
Stay put!
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
That's right.  You're not.
Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
turn around.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
Be my guest.
I'm right behind you.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Forget it.  It would take days.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
You know Meyerling?
Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
I'm here to do my job.
Yeah?
Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Too bad we're heading west.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
Have to get these wet things off.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
Told you I'm fine!
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
It's a spring day...
Stay still.
Where's my ELT?
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
You got one?
It was blown up with the plane.
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Hate to disappoint you.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
Don't push me..!
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
I already have.
You don't know how true that is.
You broke the radio, remember?
I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.
No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal.  And no way -more-
Shut up!
Answer and I'll shoot!
You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-
Can you walk?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Let's get out of here.
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Just passing through.
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
All this for laying traps on private land?
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Nothing personal.
I need to rent a cabin.
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
What are you talking about?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
Neff, you know better than this...
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Fuck you.
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
We'll go with you.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
I'll let you know what happens.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Better than one.
Is there a problem?
Right.
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Where?
What?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
No.  No I'm not.
Where you from?
What is this?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
Why?  What happened?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Probably.
What are you doing?
What?
You're right.  Talking too much again.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Just do your job.
What are you doing?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
You can't --
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
No fucking way.
Okay, don't.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
Sounds like chickenshit --
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
We both know what you were doing.
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
Tachlinkov.
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
So what happens now?
We go around once.
Bullshit.
Okay.
What?  What's okay?
What are you doing?
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
What does that fucking mean?
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
I ain't scared of you.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
Five million dollars?
That's right.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Oh, yeah.
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
You would be.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Why don't you tell me.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
Game over, bitch!
Bain!
I'm on the scent.
What?
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Take us there.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
I bet you fucking know!
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
Is this how it went, Nick?
You think this is a fucking joke?
A player?
What?
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Um, five.
One hour per man.
Get on the expressway.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah?
Bullshit.
Yeah.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Twenty large?  That's all?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
Ten million --
Now you understand why I'm here.
Now what?
Turn off the engine.
You want me to pump?
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Okay.  How did you find me?
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
You didn't know anything about me.
Nikita?
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
'Them'?
An assassin?
Until a minute ago.
What does that mean?
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
Who is that other guy?
Another contractor.
Someone hired both of you?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
So this is something between you and him?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Because he is trying to retire me.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.
Why?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
I don't need the money.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Why?
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
How?
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
What do you want to know?
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
No.
Why?
Because I'm done.
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
It's not the same, is it?
Had?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
It looks like white's game.
We played with a code using The New York Times obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Why didn't you finish this game?
He was... taken.
I killed him.
Why?
Where you wanted to be?
How did you get into the business?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
The C.I.A.?
More or less.
How old were you?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Jesus -- why?
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
You were like a boy genius?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Why not?
I was just different.
You went from high school to the Agency?
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
No, they didn't.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Ahhhh...
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
The exotic women.
Women?  No... not really.
Why not?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why?
Because you are a women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
They tried to kill you?
Tell me about the first time.
My first take?
Why?
Because I want to know.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
Are they usually like that?
No.  Just the first one.
After that?
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
That's fiction.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
No.  Something honest.
You said you didn't trust it.
I don't.
Do you have a passport?
Several.
Good.
Mexico.
Hey, where are you?
Thinking.
About?
Nothing.
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
I don't know.
You were there?
That's where he'll be.
What?
No.
Why not?
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
Work.  The things I need to get done.
Yes.
No.
Not even a stalemate?
No.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Do you think he's here?
In Costa Blanca.
What do you think he's doing?
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Breakfast.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
Okay.
Really?
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
You should knock.
Sorry.
The beach?  It was nice.
Where did you learn it?
Taiwan.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Two way?
Transmits and receives.
Cheap as shit.
I paid a lot for these.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
Fine.
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
Check.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
But he won't shoot you right then?
No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
Okay.  Then what?
Then, we wait.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
That means you won't have a gun.
That's right.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
We split the money?
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Except --
What?
I told you, he will.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
I was.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
For Nicholai?
Yes.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
I don't believe that.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Ten years ago.
Yes.
What happened?
What did he want?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
What did he say?
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
Was that it?
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Ten years later, here you are again.
Yes.  Here I am again.
Do you have ulcers?
No.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
They're worth less points.
So?
Did you think they were newlyweds?
I didn't notice them.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
How do you know they're not?
I went into their room this afternoon.
What?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Nobody ever sees me.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
No.
No?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Why?
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
And you were drilling these holes...?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
What are you doing?
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
Why?  I don't know.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Both.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
What happened to her?
She was taken.
Did you --
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Was she the only one?
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Is this becoming complicated?
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
No.
When did it start?
Honestly?
Uh-huh.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Why?
I'm not normal.
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
What?
I waited another four minutes.
Shit.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Right.
I'm taking off my mike.
Electra --
What?
Last night --
Was nice.
Yes.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
Oh, God.  I see it!
I wasn't watching television.
I thought it was interesting --
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
A pleasure doing business with you.
Yes.  Please come in.
I prefer it like this.
Would you like a drink?
Why are you working today?
You're very good at this aren't you?
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Honesty.
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Do you believe that?
You thirsty?
I'm on duty.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Of course.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
How much farther?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
Sure.
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
I think I've heard of you.
It's possible.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
It's a common question.
A dime.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Average.
Shit... oh well.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Right.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
What are you thinking about?
Can I ask you something?
Go ahead.
What do other guys do?
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Some.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Can I ask you a question?
Anything.
Why didn't you fade?
You mean quit?
Yeah.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
No.
That's correct.
American currency.
I have all day.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Thank you.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Is that all there is?
Why not?
Something back home?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Raw deal.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You know what I'm saying here.
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
You don't mind?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
You expect me to believe that?
What do you mean?
How you doing, Cato?
What you been doing?
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
Where'd you get them antlers?
She plays the clarinet, too.
That's what he told you, huh?
Okay.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
What'd they look like?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
What do you feed him?
Does he bite?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
They're okay.
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
Sure.
Tom...
Thanks.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
Sure is pretty.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
Yeah.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
Hi.
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
Cause I can't allow it.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
You love him?
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
No.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Holly.
What for?
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like druthers, doesn't it?
It's okay.
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
You still in school?
Nah, I got me a job.
Doing what?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
That's my father. I got to run.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
What?
Can I be honest?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Yeah.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
There you go.
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
Hi.
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Spanish.
How do you say Quit my Job in Spanish?
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
I don't know.
Well, I got homework.
Bring it along.
You're a redhead.
I know.
Anybody ever call you Red?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why not?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Yeah?
Okay.
What a nice place.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
My stomach's growling.
No.
Somebody else is going to get it.
I don't care.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Don't ask me.
What?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
Don't call me stupid.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
I came in the front.
How bad off is he?
I can look and see.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
Are you sure?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Why?
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
How you doing?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Yeah, me too.
The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast...
He was nervous.
Put that down. It's dirty.
I got him in the stomach.
Is he upset?
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Just looking.
Think I got 'em?
What'd you put him in there for?
Just to keep him out of the sun.
You tired?
I don't want a steak.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Excuse me.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Don't.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Positive?
Yes.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
I'd like to get out of here.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I don't blame him.
Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other.
That's Montana over there.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
Everybody loves trout.
I'm serious.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
It was going too fast.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
How about over here?
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
No.
What?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Yeah.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Hi.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Well, he didn't have it last night.
What's that?
Hi.
This your place?
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Okay, no monkey business then.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
You didn't walk out here.
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Git.
Hi.
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
Think I'll take the juice?
You tossed my hat out the window.
No.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Just a shower?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
How about you? Will you be alright?
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres Ã» please call me Barton.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Please, Barton.
I see.
...I know this must look... funny.
No, no Ã»
Let him go.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Really?...
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his Ã»
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Hello.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this Ã» believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I Ã» I'm sorry - listen, how are you Ã» I'm sorry. You doing okay?
...Who is this?
If you could, I'd Ã»
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Hello, Barton.
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
Well I have to come up with Ã» an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
What are they like? What are they about?
Well... THIS.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his Ã» what about before that?
Before what?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Barton!
I want to know!
Hah!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
I'll bet. Jesus Ã» The grand productive days. What a goddamn phony.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Bill Ã»
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
Stop it, Bill!
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks Ã» well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrationalÃ»
...Who is this?
...Who?
I write.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
What DID you mean?
I Ã» I've got respect for Ã» for working guys, like you Ã»
How long you been up there, Fink?
A week, eight, nine days Ã»
Ever talk to him?
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
Yeah, he's funny that way.
I...
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
What else?
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Well... actually, no Bill...
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man Ã» to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent Ã» don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
What's that?
Are you all right?
I'm sorry, I just feel like Ã»I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
I need help, Audrey.
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the Ã»
...Huh? No, I'm Ã»
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Then who should I talk to?
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Who?
Wuddya got for me Ã» what the hell happened to your face?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps Ã» this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well I...
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting startedÃ»
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
He's a great writer Ã»
A souse!
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
You thought! Where'd you get THAT from?  You thought! I don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He's taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER!
I don't understand-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
I didn't say anything-
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going Ã» don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
To do what?
What do you do far a living?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism Ã» if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
No, what did it say?
Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash Ã» strike that, a lot of cash.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland Ã» I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Okay.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
What do you mean, Barton?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that Ã»
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
...Barton, is everything okay?
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little Ã»
Sound a little what?
Well, you just... sound a littleÃ»
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
That's all right, really, thank you.
All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people Ã» that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need Ã» a fella could do worse.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Pictures! Jesus!
...Is the egg showing or what?!
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies Ã» though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
What do I write about?
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York Ã» hopefully our numbers are growing Ã» who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths Ã» not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Hell, I could tell you some storiesÃ»
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and Ã» and Ã» and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying Ã» a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
And I could tell you some stories Ã»
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man Ã» from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and Ã» and Ã» and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and Ã» well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Well, we've got something in common then.
Well, I can tell you some stories Ã»
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
See you, Charlie.
Charlie. How are you.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet Ã» what happened to your ear?
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Seen a doctor?
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
Nope.
I myself have yet to be lassoed.
...Got a sweetheart?
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back Ã» with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
...What's the expression Ã» me myself and I.
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time Ã»
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine Ã» you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
...This must be boring you.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor Ã» though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong Ã» Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself Ã»
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration Ã»
Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
...All right now, when I say Ready... wrestle!  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
...Yeah, okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
I hope these are your shoes.
Hi, Charlie.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started Ã» I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me Ã» my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Yeah, but Ã»
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
Where there's life there's hope.
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact Ã» New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me Ã» I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
...Your room does that too?
What a dump...
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
Well...
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
What do you mean?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
So they say.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
...Can I come in?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
No... no...
Barton. Are you all right?
Why don't we go to your room-
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
I've gotta call the police Ã» or you could call for me Ã»
Hold on Ã»
You gotta believe me Ã»
Hold on Ã»
I didn't do this, I did NOT do thisÃ»
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
We gotta call the police Ã»
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Yeah.
What do you think happened?
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
But I didn't do it Ã» don't you believe me?
I believe you Ã» I KNOW you. But why should the police?
Jesus... They can tell that...
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy Ã» like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
...I just don't know what... to doÃ»
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on Ã» just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Yeah, but Charlie Ã»
Sure, Charlie.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime Ã» when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
It's more than I've got.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
You'll be back?
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me Ã» Charlie.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
But Charlie Ã» why me? Why Ã»
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
I'm at the Earle.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
...Yes, thank you.
...Both maybe?
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
Mr. Lipnik, I Ã»
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help Ã»
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider Ã»
Mr. Lipnik.
Congratulations.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Yes sir.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
I tried to show you something beautiful.  Something about all of US Ã»
Must be.
Excuse me?
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Huh?
What Ã»
The others are being sent.
Uh-huh.
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Yeah.
Is this multiple choice?
Nine days Ã» Tuesday Ã»
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
What did... What did he Ã»
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
Charlie... Charlie's back...
No kidding, bright boy Ã» we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Big fuckin' deal.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Would that be good enough for ya?
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
He's a little funny in the head.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
All of which he's now missin'.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Physician, heal thyself.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
But, you know, with the head still on.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Give you nose bleeds?
You two have some sick sex thing?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
...Fred...
No.
Yeah.
Yeah, I was drinking.
A couple days ago.
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
She was there, wasn't she?
Did you find out about her parents?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
Bring 1976 up.
How are you, Nick?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
So -- how are things?
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
How is your -- personal life?
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
How about the booze?
It's been three months.
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
How's not smoking?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
What was she like?
Who?
Catherine Tramell.
She said what you said she'd say.
We were in some of the same classes.
Why didn't you tell me?
I need a cigarette.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
No, Nick, please --
Who?
Nilsen.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What was she like in school?
I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
I don't need any help.
Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
What is this interest you've got in her?
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
I thought you hardly know her.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
What do you want, Nick?
Tell me about Catherine.
She told you, didn't she?
What did she tell me, Beth?
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
I had him in two classes.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
Why did you change your name?
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
You should do something about this lock.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
Put your hands up!
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
What?
I'm De...
How long were you dating him?
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
Were you with him last night?
Yes.
Did you leave the club with him?
Yes.
Did you go home with him?
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
Was there anyone with you last night?
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Are you arresting me?
If that's the way you want to play it.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Only when they make interesting reading.
Do you have a cigarette?
Yes, you do.
I quit.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
I told you -- I quit.
It won't last.
What's your new book about?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
Did I miss something?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
I have nothing to hide.
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
How did you feel when he died?
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
But you didn't hurt --
No.
Because you didn't love him --
Even though you were fucking him.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
Sure.
Thanks.
I'm tired.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
Why not?
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Am I... disturbing you?
No.  Come in.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
You tell me.
I don't know.  But you do.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
There's a name from the past.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
So...who's Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
She wiped out her whole family.
Didn't you study it in school?
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
No.
I didn't.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
How exactly did you hear?
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I like you.
Do you?
Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink?
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
Not me.
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
Fine.
Ice?
Please.
What did you pay Nilsen?
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
It's not the same thing, is it?
Say -- What do you want from me
Aren't you going to thank me?
What's it about?
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
Why does he do it?
To see if he can get away with it.
When did you write it?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
No.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
I'll risk it.
Why take the risk?
To see if I can get away with it.
How's your new book?
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
She's seen everything before.
Did you think it was so special?
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
What did you think?
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
Do you want her to join us sometime?
How's your shoulder?
Fine.  How's your back?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
You shouldn't play this game.
I don't have a choice.
You're in over your head.
I know.
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
Did you like her to watch?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
Everybody that I care about dies.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
I never have before.
No.
No?
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
You won't believe me.
Try me.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
When?
About three months before I met you.
Why?
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
Do you believe me?
I'll convince you.
What did he say?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Funny.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
I found Lisa Henderson.
Did you?  What's she doing?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
Liar.
How'd you get in here?
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No.
Come over here and tell me no.
I have to do some research tomorrow.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
No thanks.
What are you researching?
Really.  What are you writing about.
What happens to them?
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
It won't sell.
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
How did it end?
I told you.  She kills him.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
What do we do now, Nick?
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
I hate rugrats.
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
No thank you.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
No.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
How did he die?
He was murdered.
Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
You have the right to an attorney.
Why would I need an attorney?
You workin' on another book?
Yes I am.
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
How's that?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
Sometimes.
What kind of drugs?
Cocaine.
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Were there ever any suspects?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Routine.
Do you remember his name?
Nilsen?
Was she ever a suspect?
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
Thanks.
You did.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
Not now he don't.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
How'd it go, son?
Hallelujah.
What you doin', son?
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
What are you doing here, Pop?
I came in here to jack off the damn machine.  One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor.
Was she ever suspect?
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
What's goin' down, son?
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
What is it you got between you?
I don't know.
Somethin', though.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
I don't think it's funny.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I know what that's like.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
I went over last night, too.
I wasn't there last night, either.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You don't like punk rockers?
I feel fine!
I'm not afraid of her.
Why the hell not?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
Catherine says you don't like her.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
I don't believe it.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
Catherine told me what was in it.
If she's telling  you the truth.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got.  You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after?  Oh, man.
I'm going with you.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
Maybe the maid did it.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
Homicide.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
What was the motive?
What was it?
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
So what do we do -- nothing?
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
I'm sure.
Now what?
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Fuck you, Phil.
What about me?
No.
She killed him.
You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Who are you?
How old was she when this happened?
Did you check all four years?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
It's cold.
No, actually I feel worse.
Alright, thanks.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Affair ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
I guess this mean we won.
Right.  Sure.  And Peace on earth
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
We've met.
Have we?
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
You mean mistook me?
Yes and no ...
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well that's a ... long story ...
I'm listed.
I'm tempted.
Pouring myself into my work.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
Treat to be here.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, Batman Blows It?  The guy probably prevented millions in property damage.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
We?  You and...
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Yes and no...
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Had one.  Didn't work.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Nope, I told her everything.
And the truth frightened her?
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because I had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Sure.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
It's the so-called normal guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Nor I, on the second.
What're you doing three dates from now?
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
No hard feelings?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
You first.
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge or the jury... I mean, just who do you think you are?
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
... What do we do?
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
No.  No glass on the inside.
Weird, huh?
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Not compared to that Cobblepot person you're promoting...
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
What happened?
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
I am the light of this city.  And I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the mayor?
It does to me.
Yawn.
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
Let's make a deal.  Other than my blood, what can I off--
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Was.
One way to find out?
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Y'mean frame him?
Well, a plan is forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Son!
Yes.  Yes.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Is it drug related?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Silent night, violent night...
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
What, is that supposed to hypnotize me?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Well it's not working.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my human name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows I know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
Wonder if it's worth my time.
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  Frigid ...
You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot.  Your table is ready
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I don't.  So, no.
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
Working late?  I'm touched.
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
Well I figured that your password was Finster.  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Big giant capacitor.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- sucking power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A secretary --
And a very, very good one.
Too good?
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is moi.
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Actually, it's a lot like that.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
The dreams again, sir?
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
Hardly a worry, sir.
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
It'll never work.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
Scholarly research?
She has an excellent mind.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Apology hastily retracted.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
What did you say?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Don't be ridiculous.
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
Is he all right?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
Why do I keep doing this?
Why, indeed?
Dr. Meridian...
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
How are you feeling, young man?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
Perhaps the fall...
What?
...Afraid.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
...A bat.
What?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Master, Bruce?
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
All the answers are numbers.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Letters in the alphabet.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.
And another name for Mystery?
Enigma.
What now sir?
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Tonight's a good night.
Al?
Master Wayne's dead wives.
Just checking, young sir.
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
And you are?
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
He's home. I sent the signal.
What's wrong?
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets.
Now black rubber.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
We all wear masks.
My life's an open book. You read?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
You are direct, aren't you?
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
I haven't had much luck with women...
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Mr...?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
We'll talk some other -
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
Nostrovia.
Slanta.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
On occasion. Usually at night.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
Exactly.
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
What do you know about obsession?
Not much.
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
To kill me.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
That's usually my line.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me.
And into a black dress.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Like normal folks.
That kid is amazing.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
But...
Well, I met someone...
Fast work. You just moved here.
He sure did.
What?
I said I'm sure he did.
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
And now....
They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....
Find anything interesting?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Why do you do that?
What?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
I'm not-
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Touchy, touchy.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
I don't want to remember!
Stop fighting.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
I don't-.
You do know. Try.
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
...Not the bat?
What?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
What are you talking about?
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Excuse me.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Absolutely not.
What I do isn't about revenge.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Chase?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Can I at least have a drink?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Don't you mean don't need no liquor license not taken away from me?
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
How high up would you say that is?
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
The small one.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Where's the boy?
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
Take me. Let the boy go.
I'm -- I'm sorry...
GET IN THE CAR!!
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
Shouldn't we --
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
Can't we --
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
How much do you weigh?
... A hundred and eight?
...Not even a 'thank you'?
Well -- I think you might consider
I'll have to ask you for that film.
I won't let you have it.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
I'll take you with me.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
... Where are you taking me?
... How long have I been out?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
How'd you find this place?
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
I loathe bats.
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
What is that?
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Great.  Give me a grant.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
What do we do?
This is Miss Vale. -- That felt redundant.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
What is it you want?
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
As far as I know.
Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
Do you sail?
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
No.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
What did you see?
... Terror.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
I don't want to go --
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Maybe we should just kiss.
... We could try that.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
... Looks like a convention.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I wish you'd...
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
No one would miss me.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
Did -- did you --
I feel naked without it.
It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up.
Keep her on the line!
... Where are you calling from?
Finding out where she is.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Got it!
What now?
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
What about Pike?
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Okay.
You framed-him...
... Thank you.
And you want a --
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
... Why the mask?
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
How'd you know it was me?
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
No.
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Where does one man get all this junk?
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
What were you thinking?
Yum, yum.
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Peanuts?
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
You are on drugs.
Are they paying you for all this?
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Alexander... I know you.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Allie, he's not.
Not what?
He's not crazy.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
It's gone.
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Yeah. Deja vu.
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
HOLY SHIT!!
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Holy shit. Holy...
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
What do you mean, alone?
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Hey, honey.
Hey.
Shut up.  West's dead.
You too?
Why not?
I asked for a policeman.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
It's... too slow.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
What do you like then?
I don't know... I like the Army.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
You did Basic here?
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
There's no need...
They're dead, aren't they?
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Okay.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Some.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
I'm not.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You're ruthless.
You're not so bad yourself.
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
I'm serious --
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
I didn't shoot West --
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
You saw West's body.
Yeah --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
You saved Kendall's life --
But not Pike's.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
We're not finished yet --
We don't need the tapes --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
We've found all of them.
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
Jesus!
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Could be Leon's.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Do what?
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
And the bodies?
You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Washout rejects, guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead...
He's telling the truth up to a point...
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Epilepsy.
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
What business?
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Where?
The creek bed --
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Back up.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Answer the phone.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Answer it.
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Would you have believed me?
Where's the cabin?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Can't do that now, though, can you?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
How do you know that?
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
He wouldn't kill anybody...
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
That's good.
Well, that's great.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Promise?
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
So you killed him?
West's. Any kindling for afire?
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Where have you been, Jay?
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Roberto, what the fuck?
We just want to check your pack --
Why?
You know it's not like that --
Do I?
Right?
Yeah...
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
See you later.  Good luck.
Thank you.
Don't be late.
If not you, then who?
Oh, come on --
That's exactly what he says about you.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
Look in my pack.
Why?
Just look. Little pocket.
You're lying --
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
Why... why didn't you tell me?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
They?
Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
I... I don't know...
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
Put it down!
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
But not the only victim, right?
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
I think you just blew Don't Ask
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called motive and you just gave yourself one.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
I didn't kill him --
Then who did?
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
But you didn't.
No. Poetic justice, though.
He admitted it.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Why did he come back for you?
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Stop.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
I'm not moody.
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Is it the truth?
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
No. I said Dunbar.
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said Dunbar was gone
I believe your next line is What are you trying to hide?
Well?
Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
Something funny, Levi?
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
I didn't do anything --
Why?
How do you know?
Because I was standing next to him.
I didn't --
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
How old are your kids?
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
I don't know --
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
Maybe he...
How are you?
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
What kind of trouble are you in?
That bad?
Tell me what I can do.
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
The official term for it is Clusterfuck. By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
Well, he's a good soldier.
The exercise was one of his Section Eight private sessions. Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
And the problem is you only got three.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
What?
Why?
Survival.
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Two years.
Then they weren't created to go after your patient zero.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
Where to first?
The House of Pain.
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
I haven't forgotten.
What is it with you people and pain?
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
What was that?
Nothing.
You're hurt.
What about Nomak?
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
I didn't know.
how long since he was bitten?
Minutes.
Recognize him?
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Fry 'em.
Blade.
Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death.
Anyone else make it?
I don't think so.
Thank you.
For what?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
You don't want to go there.
Why?
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
Why do you hate us so much?
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
You're hurting me.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Not what.  Who.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Who killed Pike?
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
It means bloodbrother.
I don't understand.
How does it look?
Not good.
What do you want me to do?
I want to see the sun rise.
How do you feel?
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
You came back for me.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Took you long enough.
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
Either that or feeding the worms.
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
I don't like it.
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Not for me.
Where were you, Whistler?
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Your security's for shit, kid.
Where the hell have you been?
What's your problem, Whistler?
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Then who does he work for?
Blood...
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
You mean not enough to save you.
Thought you were dead.
For what?
You want me to hunt them for you.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
Too bad you're out of it.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Tom, where are you going --
Home, I'm done.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Getting your attention, Paco.
You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
What the fuck you doing?
His name is Jared Nomak.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
What the hell are you talking about --
We're locked in.
Maybe it's better that way.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
What I said before --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.
Does Osborne agree?
The hell are you fiddling with there?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
Pretty.
What about you?  You're not coming?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Whistler!
Are we bringing home strays now?
She's been bitten.
You should've killed her, then.
She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Just do it, old man.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
Get in. YouÃ†re leaving.
Wait.
What took you so long?
Don't even start, old man.
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
That's horseshit and you know it.
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
Going somewhere?
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
Don't try to talk --
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
No, we can treat the wounds --
Whistler, I --
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
How can you be out here?
I don't buy it.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Pass.
Frost!!!
Who dies first?
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
You think you could explain all this to me?
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
You're blind --
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Who is LaMagra?
The Blood Tide.
How do I stop it?
But I just got here --
You shouldn't be here.
-- he's a vampire.
You're joking --
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
What happens then?
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
The Senator...
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
How did you know?
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
You used me as bait?!
But, he could've --
But he's a policeman --
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
And that's a good thing?
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
Preventive medicine.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
There is no cure.
You don't know that.
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
Look closer.
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
He will.
I'm sorry, Bill.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
The way they move, they way they smell --
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like me.
What is this place?
Some kind of archive --
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
You're hurt --
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
What am I injecting you with?
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
You get used to the darkness.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Just get out of here.
Blade --
For your miracle cure?
Is he sick?
Cancer.
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
What are you talking about?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're drunk --
I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
Any progress?
Some. It's been slow --
You don't look so good.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
Is it bad?
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
It won't work on you.
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
tearing me  apart.
I know. Take some of my blood.
No --
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
Stay where you are.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
For them. But for me --
How's it going, Kam?
I was in the neighborhood.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
But you -- died --
Fight him --
Please --
You don't have to be.
I don't believe that.
This isn't human blood.
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
That's preposterous --
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
I wanted to see if he was okay --
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
I'm not even going to dignify that --
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Not for long.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about us.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
What?
Sometimes --
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
Get your hands away from the desk!
LaMagra --
You.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
Blade --
What -- ?
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
Who are you people?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
Hostile and uncooperative.
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
We keep in radio contact.
You've been listening in the whole time?
You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
Whistler!
Go on, I'll be fine!
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
Why do you hunt them?
Habit, mostly, just like this.
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
He killed them?
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
How did you escape?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
I'll take my chances.
Ah, Christ
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
How?
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
What happened to the power?
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
You and the Colonel go back.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Move him.
Why?
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Excuse me?
Is Dunbar cute?
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
Good cop/bad cop?
Something like that.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
Baseball?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You made me look like an idiot --
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
What is that?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
You're kidding.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
The very same.
I plan to grow on you.
You're off to a late start.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
What point?
Something wrong?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Not the happiest of memories?
Keep them out of my way.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
I lied. Wait for it...
I don't think that has anything to do with --
That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
I am?
It won't?
Thanks, Meurice.
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
Abby. What's the matter?
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
No, I--
Well I do...
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
Abby...
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Sort of...
I don't know.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
Meurice--
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
...Ray?
What was that?
Your husband.
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Where... where you going?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Who was it?
What?
On the phone. Was it for you?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Well... the couch would be all right...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I could've sworn I heard something.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
...Well I'll be damned.
I couldn't believe it either...
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Yeah? What happened?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
Uh-huh.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
What'd he say?
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
Abby... you all right?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
...You all right?
I don't know. I better get off now.
Abby--
You're bad.
...What?
I said you're bad.
Why didn't you get into bed?
Yeah...
Yeah.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Watch me.
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
...What do you mean?
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
Yeah.
Well... what happened?
Ray--
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
What the hell happened, Ray?
...That's what's important.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...What was that?
Marty.
...What's going on with you two?
All right...
In the trunk.
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
Isn't that what you want?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
With your gun?...
...So?
I think someone's watching.
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
So how long have you know Meurice?
...So what're you doing tonight?
We don't seem to be communicating--
I own the place.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my great second chance, Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
But you will.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
What night is it?
What what?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
Why do you care?
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
Then what'd you come here for?
You owe me for two weeks.
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
What do you mean...
...Just doin' my job.
How long did you watch her?
No. It just made them feel better.
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
Got a job for you.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
It's not strictly legal.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
You want me to kill 'em.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Well what?
You're an idiot.
I didn't shoot West...
What?
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
For the money.
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
...There's a big--
I want you to go fishing.
...What?
Yeah. Is it...
Ya catch any fish?
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
...What kind of fish?
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Got something to show me first?
Dead, huh?
So it would seem.
...What did you do with the bodies?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Jesus, I don't believe it...
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
Of course.
Nobody knows you hired me?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...it's too damn risky.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
What happened next?
...Count it if you want.
Nah, I trust ya.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Has Ray come in yet?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
How would I know?
I don't know, didn't he call?
What's this?
You said the usual--
Right. Sorry.
What.
Don't throw that out.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
Right.
What's this?
What.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
That's not the point.
What's the point?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Meurice...
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Howdy stranger.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea...
Is Marty here?
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
For what?
Got a problem, Meurice?
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Dunbar.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Buttfucks the cabin?
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
That bugs you too?
Let's go talk to Bill...
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
What's that?
Where was I?
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
What day is it today, Angie?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
We're fucked, I know --
They got their stories straight.
What?
What Kendall said -- the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around. That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
Are you sure?
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
Good idea.
That's a fantastic idea --
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
I pushed him too hard.
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to get the truth.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
You wanted to break him.
Yeah.
I am butcher.
Dog food.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Nah.
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
For what?
That's gonna stay my secret.
We were close to something with Kendall.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
No.
Good, just making sure.
Four --
Get in.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Hardy, what are you doing --
Isn't this how your story goes?
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
No bodies, no West...
We need to talk --
What?
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said.
No.  Are you proposing?
This isn't the time --
What if I don't want it?
Tough.
That's not true.
You're a good man, Hardy.
Really.
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
West?
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Nah.
Want company?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
I should probably write that down.
Yeah.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
How?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
Pike, please --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going.
Oh, you remember now --
So you took off your shirt?
We just want --
He wanted more than that.
No one else heard it?
He whispered it in my ear.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
But you didn't see it, right?
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Pike never confessed.
We've been making progress, I see.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Fifty minutes.
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
How you doin' Mister D?
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
It could've happened to anyone.
I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
So -- where do we start?
I want you to hit all the dealers in town.  Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use.  Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in Roseburg.
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
I'm trying.
No -- but I got something.
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Why?
Because it hasn't all been erased.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
You got something on the Coke?
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Take some time off.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
I don't know.
You did a good job, Charlie.
Dunbar says you were.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
About three hours.
Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
Yes.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
A massive cardiac arrest.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
No.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Yes.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
You can't threaten me --
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
You can't show intent.
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
She's innocent.
Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
What?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
I didn't hear it.
Back off, John.
That's ridiculous.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You've been following me?
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
It won't work --
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Can I go?
I have.
No.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
I had some papers to pick up.
Rebecca Lawson.
Six years.
No -- never.
Yes.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
Wait --
We were lovers.
For about one year.
Intense.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
I had a bad heart.
I had bypass surgery.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
She left me.
She didn't.  She just left.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I felt she could read my mind.  It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted.  A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had handcuffed me to the bed.
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Yes.
She was.
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Wrong answer --
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
I suggest it never happened.
No further questions.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
Who, Levi --
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
What did you prescribe for her?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
High school?
Where did you meet him?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Then what happened?
And What did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
Did he make your life miserable?
How?
What did he say?
Do you remember his exact words?
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
You'll be my first.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
What happened next?
What changed?
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
No.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes -- cocaine.
How do you know that?
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
Yes -- he mentioned it.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
I suppose.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
Who told you that?
He video taped you.
That bastard!
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
Yes.
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
I've tried it.
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
I've been to a few -- yes.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
No.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
Yes.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Yes.
And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
And that he changed his will?
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Yes.
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Dristan nasal spray.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Three fifteen.
A.M -- or P.M.?
P.M.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
I don't know.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
No.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
What do you have in your purse?
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Why'd you come here?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
You didn't know about it before that?
No.
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Because he called me.
Hi, Joe.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
Yes.
And she left shortly after that?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Yes.
No further questions.
Are you going to represent me?
Do you think I did it?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
You still haven't answered my question.
Frank!
I'll have you out in a few hours.
What the fuck happened to you --
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
Something like that.
We're not animals.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
I thought the subject was sex?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Yes.
How?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Why not?
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
Try.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
How'd you meet Marsh?
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Why didn't you live together?
Sure.  Where to?
This is your house.
I know.
Why not?
Is it against the law?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
What do you think?
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Tastes can change.
Nothing.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
Hello?
Hi.  It's Frank.
Hi, Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
Yeah.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
Sorry.
It's okay.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
It won't be that hard.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Really?
Yeah.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
What would?
You and me -- making love.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
You take a lot for granted.
You lied to me!
What?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
She's mistaken.
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Why would she lie?
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
Thank God...
I went out on the boat.
Alone?
Of course.
You were brilliant today.
It's only the beginning.
Can I see you later?
You can see me now.
Something wrong?
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Honey.
What are you going you doing?
Are you scared?
What's that for?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
You killed him -- didn't you?
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You don't need anybody.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
I'm dropping the case.
No -- you're not.
You're a monster.
No -- I'm a survivor.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off.
That's crazy.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
Shoot him.
No -- he's lying.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
Don't listen to him.  Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
Why?
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
Alright, I'll talk to her
What are they saying?
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I love you.
Michael -- get off the phone.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities.  Who told you to say that?
No, Your Honor.
But Your Honor--
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
Mr. Roston?
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
How often do you use cocaine?
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
I can back it up.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
I am relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
Really?
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
I'm always open to learning new things.
Can't it wait?
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
Some example you set.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
If he files are you going to take the case?
What's she like?
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Humped
Yes.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
I'll talk to him later.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
We have to talk.
What's wrong?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
Where have you been?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Yes.
Why did you lie to me?
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
No.
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
I know.
Talk to me.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Please -- not now.
Why didn't you come to me?
I don't know.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It was a place to start.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
That's too bad.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Get down on your knees.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Yes.
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
No -- never.
It didn't get there from me.
Yeah.
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
So?
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Then it's unofficial.
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
You think he did it?
What do you think?
It's too neat.
You want Kendall, don't you?
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
We know.
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
Where's your partner?
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go!  Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
You want to get into this now?
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
Two point one seventy-six.
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
What's that, Johnnie?
The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...
Where is this going, Johnnie?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Know what?
Open the case!
You don't need a key.
How the fuck can I open it?
What are you talking about?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
The next one blows off your dick.
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Sit down, Gino!
Stay away!
No!
I can't.  I can't.
All part of the business.
I didn't expect --
What the fuck is going on?
Oh, shit ...
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
She's doing the work herself.
So, you just got out?
Jesus, Caesar!
What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
What are you going to do with it?
I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
They were early.
They just left, didn't they?
You mean they weren't up here?
No!  They're still on their way.
Why?
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
What?
It couldn't have been.
It was him.  I'm positive.
It's impossible!
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
But you know he did it.
Got to think this through ...
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Violet, please!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
All right, Caesar.
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
The money?  The money's gone.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
But it could be anywhere.
He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.
He didn't see you, did he?
No.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
This is insane!
You can't leave.
The hell I can't!
I need you ...
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
Violet, I won't let you leave.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
Caesar ...
Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie.
Tell them!  Tell them!
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
...  maybe three hours.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
What happened to them?
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
Fuck.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
It's not here, Caesar.
Where, then?
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
We're going to need some time.
Who are you going to call?
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Just hurry.
Where is the money?
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
He can't kill you --
Violet!
Not until he has the money!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Shut up, Violet.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
What did she do to you?
Everything you couldn't.
I saved you.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
You murdered Gino!
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Shut up!
What?
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
Good boy.
We were in a car accident --
But everybody is all right.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ...
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
I'm listening.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Sure, Gino, sure.
Now that's teamwork.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Caesar, don't.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Caesar, you don't know shit.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Oh, right.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Where's the fucking money?
No.  Rajeev's in India.
How many'd you do?
Five.
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
What?  How about a drink?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Sure.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Lick me.
Where is it?
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
No.
You can't kill me yet.
Why?
I could be lying.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Hey, Mickey.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Me?  Why?
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
Yeah, that's it.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
Call me as soon as you get him.
Hello?
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
How do I know you are cops?
All right.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
...  thank you.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Who?
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
So this is temporary for you?
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
I guessed you were straight black.
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
A favor?
Oh, I'm sorry --
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Are they really?
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Truck.
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Caesar is your husband?
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
My pleasure.
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
Not exactly.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
He said you lost something.
Yeah, come on in.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Sure.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
Okay, one drink.
What do you want?
A beer?
A beer.  Of course.
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
No.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Maybe.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
Why?
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
No.
I had to see you.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
I wanted to apologize.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
...  I needed that.
Tell me about it.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
You have to ask?
No.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it The |Business.
How did you meet him?
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
He's a launderer?
How long have you been with him?
Five years is a long time.
Yes, it is.
The redistribution of wealth.
What?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
I'm already in your bed.
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
I'm glad you did.
So am I.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
We're not that different, Corky.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
I don't.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
What you heard wasn't sex.
What the fuck was it?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
What was it then?
Work.
What about that guy this morning?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
I think so, too.
Even though he knew about you?
Yes.
He was in love with you, right?
That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.
Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
What choice?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
I am, but ...
You think I'm lying?
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Is that what you think?
Do you think you know me like that?
I think ...
You said he washed the money?
Then what?  Exactly.
He hung it up.
To let it dry.
And where is it now?
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
It's in a case, on his desk.
Does the case lock?
Yes.
Good.
Johnnie?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Who is Gino?
Gino Marzzone.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
That's his brother.
...  shit.
Yeah.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah.
Sweet Jesus.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Yeah, twice.
What happened?
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What did Gino drink?
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
What time did you say they would be there?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Any bodyguards?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Where will you be?
Waiting in the apartment next door.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
Trust me, Violet.
I'm just asking, what if?
If he does ...
There is no going back.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
He'll have to run.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
Thank you.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
I won't.
I think we're going to find out.
It's me.
What happened?
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
What if he doesn't run?
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
okay, all right.
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
No.
...  Me neither.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Pop?
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Caesar wants me to stay.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I know you will.
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?  Get away from all of this.
I don't know what we're talking about.
Yes.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
And what if I couldn't do that?
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
We're exploring every possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
No.  Pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been sleeping down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we finally have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
I want a second opinion.
This is an operations desk.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
What if he is working for someone else?  What if he turned?
Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- inside the house? --
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
Forget it.
What do you want to do?
We don't know what we're into!
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
I'm going to Paris.
No you're not.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
I won't ask again.
What do you mean?
Treadstone?
Yes.
What is Treadstone?
I think so.
What do they want me to do?
Are you Treadstone?
What did you do to me?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
I don't know.
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
So now you know.
That's all I get?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
There never was a Jason Bourne.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Keep it.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
That'll be their second worst mistake.
MPG Capital.
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
Who do you think sent me?
I don't know.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Right.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Look, maybe I should just...
Yeah, I know...
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
Yes.  Is he there?
Yes.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Thanks.
Really.
Did you?
Yes.
Okay.
Excuse me?
I hadn't heard.
That'd be great.
I need a ride out of here.
Oh, Jesus...
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
You don't want the police any more than I do.
Jesus...
So what's in Paris?
I want to go home.
For twenty thousand dollars.
I said ten thousand.
No.  No, that was too easy --
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is --
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
I know that.
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
What?  Like amnesia?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I was shot twice in the back.
Okay, so you're a victim.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
I needed a break.
Where are we?
We're about an hour away.
I can't believe I slept.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
That's it?  Is that it?
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Looks familiar?
Where?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
So this is it, right?
I should go.
I don't remember any of this.
Jason...
Okay, so...
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
I guess so.
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
Go ahead.
-- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not like that --
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- quiet -- quiet --
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
...omigod, no...
-- just --
Where does this come from?   how do you have my picture?
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
He's dead isn't he?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You knew he was coming.
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Oh, Jesus...
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  I can't.
But the police --
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- how? --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
Who paid the bill?
It's a company... MPG Capital.
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
What is that?
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
I don't know.
So what are we doing?
Go back to the hotel.
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
xxxxxx.
xxxxxx
Stop where you are.
What?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
And that's it?
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  Take it.
What was I thinking, right?
What about you?
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
Can I help you?
This your store?
Yes.
Think I could rent a scooter?
You have ID?
Not really.
Shit, we didn't sign in.
Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in --
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
-- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- here we go -- I found it --
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
I'm sorry.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! --
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...here -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
What's that?
Enhance it.
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
What?
Tell him we're busy.
-- and they're sure it's him? --
What?
Where is escort service?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
What?
That'll solve all our problems.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
No ...
Pregnant.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
She's having a baby. Twins.
You can trust me on this one.
You know each other a long time?
In that time, you ever have sex?
No underwear?
Mary ...
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Mary said you might be coming.
Where is she?
Sleeping in the back.
She asked me to pick her up.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
Mary, we really have to go.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
Got a beer?
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
I should be going. I just quit.
Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
I guess I'll be going.
Just take it easy.
Does that hurt?
I can't hold up my head anymore.
You're going to live.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
What about Kanita?
Dead.
No.
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Ten-four, hon.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Ten-four.
Okay, what happened?
No. He's dead.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
What's his name?
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
No, I'd better not.
Yeah?
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
Do you have any music?
What?
John, play the Sinatra.
Is he going to be alright?
His heart's beating.
He's very very sick.
I know him. That's Noel.
I guess there's always a chance.
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
The first is always the best.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
You never know.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
At least he's got people around him.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
You shouldn't smoke.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
He's dead, huh?
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
No.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
She should go home.
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I'll be right down.
He's better, isn't he?
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
You look so different.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I think it looks good.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
How is she?
Sleeping.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
Okay.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
He's better.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
You married?
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
How long you been doing this?
Five years.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't seem so bad to me.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Okay.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Maybe I should come up with you.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
No, no.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
He'll be all right.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
This is not a good time.
Who is it?
Frank.
Come on up.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
The ghosts--
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
I think the worst is over.
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here.
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
Who's that?
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
God help us, he's hungry too.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Thanks.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
She's no whore, Marcus.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
It's coming.
Don't give me that look.
What look?
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
I hate vodka.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I'll drink to that.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Where you going?
I quit! I'm through!
You can't leave me now.
He got better.
He one of them?
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
What do you think?
The family know?
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
A medical miracle.
Last show of the night.
No.
Where's Burke?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
These are hard times, Tom.
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
I've taken that into consideration.
I never felt better in my life.
It's early for him.
Better bring it all.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
How's he doing?
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Okay, whatta I do?
That's ridiculous.
You learn that in the army?
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Do it!
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
No shit.
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
What?
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
Turn it off.
What?
You know what. The radio.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Don't push it, Larry.
You're burned out.
Mr. Oh.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
They'll just keep calling.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
He's drunk.
Faster! God!
Faster!
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Relax, will you.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Yeah, you're right.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
He's crazy.
You really think so?
Used to be my partner.
You're in the stomach!
You sure?
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
One more time!
Stomach again.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
Yes sir.
Two weeks holiday.
We are both from Prague.
Two weeks.
He doesn't speak English.
Who is he?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Yes.  Both.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Okay.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
What for?
No I don't.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
I paid for those guitar cases.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
It's enough isn't it?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Yes.
Don't fool around.
It is. I did it cooking.
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
Name it.
What are you doing here?
Leave him!
No I haven't.
Right.
Right.
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
What are you doing here?
Did you hear what I said?
Sorry. You've lost me...
I'm asking what you're here for.
What?
What did he say?
He says he feels safe here.
I need to know who you are first please.
Oh.  We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
Good.
And...
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Hold on.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right.
Right.
No.
So?
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
What was that?
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
So how long will you be in England?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
No, no...
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
She says she has a secret to tell.
What?
I saw you waiting there, by the gate.
I...
I have these uh... She explains to you... When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses. Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Binoculars.
What was that?
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
No. It's not that.
Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
How is bank?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
I understand. I'm so sorry
You can stay tonight.
Good night.
Put the fucking kettle down.
John.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
What? What does he want?
What did he say? Tell me!
He wants money.
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
We have no money.  Come on.
He wants a lot of money.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Just leave her alone.
I'm so sorry.
Is that everything?
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand ants?
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
I mean... Ants. I've got a problem with ants.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Yes.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Yes.
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Yes.
Today is bath day.
Sorry?
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
I don't understand.
Happy bath day.
Syevodnya?
Syevodnya
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
Frenzy.
Yes I know.
They go. John. They go.
What's wrong?
They go.
They go.
You don't understand anything.
I don't want to know.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
So what are you going to do?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Well as it turns out I did.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
No I don't.
In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
Where's the restroom?
What?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Have you got your passport?
What?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Yes.
What?
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Give me some money.
I don't have any money.
I said I don't have any.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Fine.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
So uh...
Oh Jesus.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
But, you know, so what?
He will come back.
Excuse me?
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
You don't want to talk about it.
No.
Okay we won't talk about it.
Scottish?
Yeah.
We'll pretend it never happened.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
And? What are you saying?
And. It's wrong.
And who says what is wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Whereas Wet 'n' Wild is an emotional journey. Tied and Tethered. It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
So let's call this the usual.
Thanks.
It takes all types.
So who's he?
Then why doesn't she?
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
I'm sorry.
How?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
She's not a girl, Col --
Whatever you say.
See that, Col?
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
Did he?
Just cut his hair, you know.
What you think?
Nice.
Saw that one.
What would you call it?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
He agreed that he was.
What do you think his name is?
I've no thoughts on the subject.
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Why?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
So now you hate all women?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
Hi, Jimmy.
He's still looking, Col.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
I would expect he does.
Ask him.
He's back, Col
Hi.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Stop it, Dil --
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
You see that, Col?
Saw it, Dil.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fucking men, Col --
Fuck off, Dave.
Did I?
Thank you.
Jimmy.
See, they get the wrong idea.
What?
You...
I got what I paid for.
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Sure, Dave --
Take your clothes.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
Do you mean that?
She's not a tart.
She's not that either.
It wasn't what I wanted.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand you either.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
It's a simple question.
Who?
Guy I work with.
What's it to you?
Nothing.
You American?
No.
Not English.
No.
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
Like treacle.
Excuse me?
Get out
Get out.
That should make her happy.
Don't know. Who is she?
He's Scottish, Col.
Jimmy.
Jimmy?
Everybody wants something.
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
You old-fashioned?
Must be.
Hi.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
What was that?
They all get the wrong idea.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?
You know.
You on the game?
You can't leave me then, can you?
You want me to ask you in, right?
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Where?
Half-five. At Millie's.
Give me that look again.
What look?
The one you gave me in the Metro.
They're jealous.
I wonder.
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Like what?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Must be.
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
How special?
You want one?
Jesus Christ!
Jesus.
That Dave?
The things a girl has to put up with.
Piss off, Dave!
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
I'm not on my own, am I?
Would you like a drink?
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Someone out there.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Thank Christ for that.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
I don't have nothing.
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Must be in love to manage that.
He lived here with you?
He was different.
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
Yes.
No --
Did you do that to him?
You want to know how I kissed him?
Yes...
Are you jealous of him?
That's good...
What would he think?
Do you miss him?
What do you think?
Do I?
Like you're concerned.
But you can t stay, you know that?
Didn't think I could.
A real gentleman...
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
I am.
Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.
He did sometimes.
Did he dance with you?
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No.
Have you had any before?
No.
Are you scared?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
Something I heard someone say once.
You mean that?
What is this?
I'm superstitious. Drink.
Can't leave me now.
Aha.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Depends what it is.
What you thinking of, hon?
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Told you, I'm superstitious.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
All the time.
Even now.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Dil --
Tell him it hurt --
I have to talk to her, Col --
Come on, Dil --
Where?
What happened between you and the blonde?
What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
She's dead.
What you doing here?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
Apologies, my sweet.
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
Never said a truer word.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Must be.
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
You could?
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
Yeah. I care, Dil.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
Nothing's wise.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
How?
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Do they know?
Know what, honey?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Details, baby, details.
So they do know.
All right, they do.
Don't.
Sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
I'm working on it.
I'm sorry.
There's Dave. He knew too.
Am I becoming repetitious?
A little.
Don't ask me in.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Only if you kiss me.
Happy now?
Delirious.
What?
He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Okay.
Come on.
You gonna tell me why?
No.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
Not here.
Dil, this is Jude.
It's her, isn't it?
What's her?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Shouldn't be, Dil
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
What?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
She's alive?
Yes.
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
I can't.
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
More than that.
You do something for me, Dil?
Anything.
You'd do anything for me?
You got the keys to the shop?
You want another haircut, baby?
No. Sit down.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Want to change you to a man, Dil...
Why?
It's a secret.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Yes.
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
You promise?
I promise.
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
I'm sorry.
You want to make me look like him...
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
So it's true, then?
You like me better like this.
Yes.
Don't call me that --
She's alive!! She is not dead?
Laugh it up.
Why?
For me.
For you...
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm going home!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
Come on...
No! I'm going home...
So tell me.
I was trying to get out of something.
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
You mean that?
Yes.
You heard what I said, Dil?
My pills...
Prescription. For my condition.
Are you supposed to take that many?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Nobody's that unhappy.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
I will be.
Good-bye, Dil
Jimmy?
What?
Don't go like that.
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
You knew my Jody?
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You knew my Jody?
Are you listening?
Yes.
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
Died...
Did you hear me?
You killed my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.
It was you...
You killed my Jody
No.
You tried.
Don't you want to kill me?
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
Okay.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
He asked me to see were you all right.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Stop it, Dil --
Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.
What was her name?
What's your name?
Let me go, Dil
Why?
Got to be somewhere.
Try and go, then.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
Let them come then.
You like me now, Jimmy?
I like you, Dil --
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More what?
More endearments.
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
You do?
What would you do for me?
Anything.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
And you'll never leave me?
Never.
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
Fergus.
What's Fergus?
It's my name, Dil --
What happened to Jimmy?
Dil!!!
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Speak English!
How you erase this?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
You know you can come under the blanket.
It's alright.
She was --
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Yes.
Tell me what she wore.
Can't remember...
Do I?
Yes. Now.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
You will, Dil
Promise?
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
Yes. Say hello to Col --
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Don't call me that --
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Stop it, Dil --
Thirty-five.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Please, Dil --
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
As the man said, it's in my nature.
What's that supposed to mean?
What was it?
You know her, Jimmy?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Thank you.
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to go across the water.
Need to lose myself awhile.
See does he want some.
Do you want some food?
Hey -- what's he like?
Horny bastard.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Have a look at him.
Can't.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's all right.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
You don't know that.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Tough work, that.
Leave us, Judie.
My pleasure.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
He's hot.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Leave me alone, Jude.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Suits you.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
So you did fuck up.
Yes.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Yeah. No thanks.
Please. Why not?
Because it was a lie.
Leave her out of this.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
She's nobody. She likes me.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
And what if I say no?
You know what. Go.
Was I?
Perfect.
And what happens then?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
And what if you don't?
You may be right.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Jude?
Some judge...
I take pride in my work.
I sincerely hope so.
Dil!
Give him a cup of tea.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Okay. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
So?
You sure?
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
Thanks.
It's your decision.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
I told him.
Are you all there?
Back in a minute, Jody
You OK about that?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Peter.
What?
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Why do you want to do that for?
Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
He's at home.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I know that.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
I understand.
Something else.
Okay. Promise?
And what's she like between the sheets?
Definitely unusual.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Aye, I do, Peter.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
A hotel?
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Thank God for that.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Good. So what do you think?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Right.
So it's on the street.
Right.
Eat something, would you?
Can't.
What do you mean you can't?
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
This is a farce, man.
So, what do I look like?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Am I?
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
Thank you, handsome.
My pleasure.
How did you know it was her?
I can smell her perfume.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
Can't we take it off?
You can probably buy them on the flight.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
Please.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
No fucking way.
What's that?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No?
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
Could you?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
So I've noticed.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Do what?
Kill me.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
I'm not a gambling man.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Not in your nature.
What do you know about my nature?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
Didn't look like that to me...
She's not my type.
C'mere.
No.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
My inside pocket.
She'd be anyone's type.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
No?
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
Suppose you could say that.
You make a nice couple.
Don't I know it.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
She's a friend of mine
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
What?
What the fuck am I doing here.
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Shouldn't take it personally.
Ever see hurling?
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Best game in the world.
Never.
The fastest.
How different?
Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .
It's not mine.
It's not mine either.
It's what you came back for.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
I'll bear that in mind.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
My pleasure, Jody
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Tree.
Can't.
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Hurry up, would you?
These things take time, Fergus.
Now put it back in.
Give us a break.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Shut up, would you?
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Fergus?
Yeah?
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
So what's that supposed to mean?
Why?
See? I was right about you.
Don't be so sure.
Jody's always right.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Tell me about it.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Doesn't matter where.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Having a pint in the Rock.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Like what?
Like having a pint in the Metro --
Having two pints in the Rock.
Who's Dil?
My special friend.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
The best.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
We don't look on it like that.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
It's as simple as that?
Yes.
Is it bad?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
I didn't.
Some kinds of women are...
She can't help it.
You liked her?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Don't know her.
What?
If they kill me --
Don't think that way.
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
See if she's all right.
Take her picture. C'mere.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
I told you not to talk that way --
Stop it --
Don't.
I'm sorry.
Help me.
How can I?
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
Go to sleep now.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
What?
A story.
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
What does that mean?
What does it mean?
Maybe you will find out.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Take the hood off, Fergus --
No.
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Why?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Stop that talk now --
The fastest.
Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
You won't run.
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
What?
The teddy bear?
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
Don't run off, Jude.
You don't know me, do you?
What if I did?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
You didn't?
Tell me, Jody
Not here.
Who gives a fuck.
You never know.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
Right.
I never know nothing.
Come and get me, soldier --
Whatever you say, Jude...
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
It was fun while it lasted.
Have you no feelings, woman?
You shut your face --
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
I said shut the fuck up --
He believes in the future --
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
That fucker's dead --
No, we are.
You're crazy --
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Is the flight full?
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Thanks.
Cash.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Ours.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
I believe you.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Because they're still here.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Were you followed?
Describe him.
No.
That's not Carson Dyle.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
CafÃš.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
That's the spirit.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
I said with the mouth shut.
Okay -- up there.
Open it.
Keep going.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
Then who does?
Me?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Not my room!
I'll take that.
Get in the bathroom!
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
You loved him?
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He was a wealthy man?
About how wealthy would you say?
Where did he keep his money?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
It is all right.
Is it all right?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- ElysÃšes  Why there?
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
And this?
And this? And this?
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list
How's that?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Good for you.
Please, not on my account.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
I'm not sure I --
Oh. I guess.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Where did everything go?
Doing what?
Instant divorce you mean?
Come on. You can't stay here.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
What's going on?
I'm still having trouble with English.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
You mean you and me?
En garde.
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
I don't think I follow you.
I wasn't --
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
What was it?
What your husband was mixed up in.
Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
We're here.
How would you like a spanking?
What?
Good night.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
What?
Go on.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
So they think he left it with you.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Who is it?
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
What'd he say?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Good night.
Va jouer, mon ange.
Ãƒa alors! From Charles?
But what?
But why do you want a divorce?
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Do you know him?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
He's allergic to him.
Who is it from?
What is it about?
Oh la vache!
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
What's the matter, chÃšrie?
We will separate -- you look over there.
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah? What's that?
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
Who invited you?
No.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
is there anything you do?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
It's almost ten o'clock.
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
You said that two weeks ago.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
I want you to head right home after school.
I will. Is that all?
Hi honey.
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
What do you mean?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
A little.
How much further?
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Not much further.
You never went, uh, all the way?
Ok.
No honey.
I'm not.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
It was a she.
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Shut up.
Does it hurt?
You know her?
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
You were eavesdropping.
No I wasn't.
What did you hear?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
No!
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No. I'll handle this.
No?
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Is Jody still awake?
Did you warn her?
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
What are you doing?
This will relax her.
She's underage.
You know where I can find her?
She works at a church?
She was murdered?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Can you get inside?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
No.
No, you couldn't.
Why?
Daddy....
You're not?
I am.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Sure.
You know about that too?
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Really?
Me? Why me?
What do you know about my father?
_ Your father raped someone?
Yes.
You're the killed.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
Go sit next to him.
Who?
Mark Shale.
Why?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
You eventually have to talk to him.
No! That's his table.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Does she fuck?
I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
Oh nice save.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
He says he loves me.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
No!
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
OK. increase the peace.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
Not that many.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Someone tried to kill me.
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
You ok?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Mark invited me to the party.
What party?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
You can't tell your parents.
Ok.
Especially not your dad.
I won't.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Stag?
I can't right now.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Twenty eight years ago.
This place is empty.
You heard about that?
Don't you think it's sick?
You Miss Dunlop?
No.
Cut it out.
Why?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I got to get home.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
What?
Are you O.K.?
I'm fine.
I did.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Why?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Did Sharon say no?
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I do not.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
They're not picking me up until six.
I'll think about it.
Yes!
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Are you coming to the party?
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Yeah.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Sharon's far from a slut.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
This party is sick.
Jody. Wait.
What?
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
My dad's down there!
I love you.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
What are you doing?
Pretend we're just another couple.
Hi mom.
Hi princess.
Mom?
Yes?
I need to ask you something.
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
Lisa Sherman?
Yeah. Who is she?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
That's what he said.
Did he say anything else about her?
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Not that I know of.
Where are you going?
The library. I'll be fine.
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
Who is she?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Don't make me order you.
Wait.
What?
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
Attacked how?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
You didn't believe her?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Why not?
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
And the police did nothing?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
The word is Mob.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Who?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
You're not telling me something.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
Yes.
Who was the fourth?
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
NO!
Yes?
Yeah.
Kenny's aunt?
On what side of the family?
His mother's an only child.
Just thinking about something.
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
I got to go.
And she didn't?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
No, you keep one.
So are you.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
At least somebody likes this shit.
help me get in the truck.
Oh...
...shit.
Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Shit!
It's a damn postal truck!
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
...that is going to explode...
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Don't want to film this?
Come on, Night Shift.
A little early for a delivery.
Oh...
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
...-ty.
Where's Sam?
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Freezer in the back.
Great.
Art.
That's my business.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...moron.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.
Uh, huh?
Except for the fact that I need cash.
He could've called first.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Huh?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
Oh.
Why don't I--?
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
Hang on.  Hang on.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
No.
What did I say?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...and a shitload of ice.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...-tana.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...truck.
...-er.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
And if that Elvis shit...
Peace.
All right.
You want cash?
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
No.
All right, then how about this?
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
...doing?!
I need your truck!
You are not takin' my truck!
Go on.
Would you hurry up, please?
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Shut...
...up.
Are you kiddin'?
Come on!
What the hell's goin' on?
It happens to this piece of shit...
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
Excuse me...
...-ed.
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Do you wanna give me a minute?
You'd better coast through...
...town.
Oh, man.
No cell.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
...-er.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
No, no, no.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
...-er.
Am I missing somethin' here?
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Borrowed.
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...
...the ice cream for money!
Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  We're goin' to McGruder.
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
That's...
...fine.
Shut up.
Hey.
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
Fine.
...-damn!
Okay, okay!
Ah, one of them's in the back.
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
Shut up.
Take your gun!
Doesn't work.
What?
Doesn't...
...work!  It's not even load-...
...-ed.
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!
Oh, shit.
Oh...
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
All right.
Okay!  All right!
Elvis is on ice again.
Okay.
Nice job back there.
Don't gimme that nice job shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...gun?!
Kiss my ass!
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
No...
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...you.
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...I believe in live and...
Yeah...
...let live.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
I did not steal the truck.
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
...truck!
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Well, then, that means it's call...
...waiting!
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.
Oh!
Holy shit...
...man!
Oh, shit.
...up!
Come on, old...
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
All right, you got it.
Fuck!
Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...Shift.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy!
I think...
...we can make it.
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
...do we?
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!
Oh, shit.
Okay.
Okay.
Goddamn!
Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Come on!
Come on, old Pete.
God, man!
Oh...
...easy, easy, easy.
Get over!  Get over!
Come on.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
I know the likeli-...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Night Shift, but you might...
Come on, old...
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on...
...you crazy bastard.
Whoo!
Whoo!
I made it!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
You okay?
What the fuck was that?!
Shit.  You gotta pass him.
Gee, you think so?
Holy--!
Okay.  That didn't work.
Gee, you think so?
Shut up!
Ho, ho...
Oh...
...ho!
...shit!
Hang on!
Hey!
Shit.
Go, go.
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
No.  Shit.
Come on.
Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.  Okay.
Yeah...
...yeah.
Aw, shit
All right, let's go.
Okay.  All right.  Okay.
Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.
Listen!  Listen...
...man!
He's crazy!
Taking it down the hill.
You're--?  What?!
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Then stay...
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
I don't want you to come anyway.
What?
Come on!
Okay.  Okay.
Oh, shit!
No!
Oh, no!
All right.  Hey.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
What?
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
Okay.
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...did you?
You're fucked, man.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...-tion?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...stole the truck.
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...piece of shit was worth.
It won't even start half the time.
You know what I'm sayin'?
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
So you took his...
...truck.
Yeah.
You know.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
We were nationally  ranked.
How wonderful for you.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
Robert Del Rio?
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
...hospital.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
We got two paddles.
Listen, Arlo...
...shit.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...-er.  It was your friend...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...shit.
...split.
...miles.
Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
That is loud!  I'm
Whoo!
Yeah, baby!
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
Hey.   Mason.
Yeah.
I think you oughta cut a...
...deal with this asshole.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
...or my conscience.
A-And you  owe me...
...man.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Bring him down!
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
Ow!
Are you all right?
No.
Listen, Arlo.
Hey!
They're takin' off.
They're movin'.
We're gonna die!
Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.
Put your hand in my pants.
What?
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
Arlo!  Arlo.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
Okay.
All right.  Okay.
Okay.
Arlo!
I'm sorry.  I'm a little
Okay.
Come on, come on!
Okay, here we go.
Come here.
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
...-natic.
That's why I didn't give it...
...to him.
What?
You got Elvis?!
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Go!
Stop.
Hang...
...on!
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
...-ful?!
Okay.  Okay.
Forty-five seven!
Oh, shit.
We!
I've got the real thing!
We've got Elvis!
Here...
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
He's comin' up fast!
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
Tunnel.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
What the hell?
What the--?
You've gotta be...
Stupid.
I'm gonna kill him.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Shoot me.
What's it say?
Forty-nine point four.
It says forty- nine.
Mason.
What?
It's melting, man.
Oh.
What?
What?
It's working.
We got-...
Vitelli! Vitelli!
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Sorry.
Hang on, hang on.
Go.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
They'll meet you at the top.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
Look out.
What'd you come back for?!
Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Stop limpin' around like that.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Always the negative...
You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You, Arlo.
Hello.
You.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Us.  Owes us.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
Patriotism is its own reward.
I think so too.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
What about all that no need to get in the man's...
...face crap you've been telling me?
...-tiatin'.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
No.
That's bullshit.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
Ooh.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Yeah.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Yeah.
you see, that was a-that was my mission.
big balls.
That's right.
Hey.
Hey, be cool.
Be cool.  Be--
That was quick.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
...about him.
I'll keep an eye out.
...within five minutes.
It's for you.
What'd he say?
Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
Listen, shithead!
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Oh, my God.
I urge you to be persuasive.
Well, well, well.
And it won't be pleasant.
But...
Vaughn.
Hey!
Well, that just about figures for today.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
Mason, you have to take this...
...to Fort McGruder in his truck.
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
...take my sorry old truck.
We do need your truck.
I had no idea how powerful it was.
Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
...here.   Mason...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
Hey, actually...
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
What the hell's a sage?
Listen, deputy.
He's the dude...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
We've got it...
Thank you.
Us.  Owe us.
Exactly.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
What is it?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
I did.
Why not?
Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
...-tor Long.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
...-lar.
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
You have my word on that.
All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
Let's proceed.
I am become Death, the...
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
No!
You'll kill us all!
It's too...
Andrew...
...I wish they would've let me say something...
...about--
There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
Is this stool taken?
No, go--
You look good, Richard.
You look fit...healthy...
...-ple.
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...that.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...and the government.
Grateful?
Mm-hm.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...you were right, of course.  But after...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
...always done, Richard?
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Went away?
Went away.  I like that.
All right.  After they put you away...
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
Forget about him.
Do you know what'll...
...happen if I drop this?
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Good to see you again, Leo.
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
I'll do it.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street.  Fan out and work your way back to the motel.
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
This is it.
Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
...comes up that road.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
Radio the bikes.
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Of which we have more than enough.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
Hit him again.
Check the immediate area.
You have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way.  I think we can impose on you for a little overtime.
Prep the launcher now.
Dennis!
Get your links set up!
I wanna patch in from...
...here!
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Stay put.  Keep the camera trained on...
This river ends at a hydro dam...
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
...-ty.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
...general store.
Richard Long.
That's right.
...-fall.
But...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...screwup?
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
...scientists.
Where's their protective...
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
Mornin'.
Is this your establishment?
....-lene.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Iced coffee.
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
Quite a getup for jacking...
...deer.
I beg your pardon?
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
Assumptions are always dangerous.
Doc...
...Long.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
Not tonight...
...though.
...should be right outside.
Yeah?
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
I don't know what the hell...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...
...never done a thing for you?
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
Elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  Get yourself some CDs.
Hello.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
You try anything, it goes in...
...the river.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
Bring him up.
Your fellow hero, untouched...
...and unharmed, de-...
...-spite the mouth.
Him first.
It won't be long, gentlemen.
Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
They took that life away and left me with nothing.
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...-time,  remember?
I can handle it.
Yeah?
Two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Oh, no?
Uh, we both like to fish.
Ah.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
That little geek is my...
...son.
Thanks.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
Been trying to figure out your secret.
My secret?
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
...like a fish.
No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout...
He's brains without ambition...
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Tie a fly...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...and that power...
...without caution...
...is death.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...fishin'.
Some people might.
Doc!
Mason.
Call an ambulance.
No...
The compound has to be kept cold...
...or it'll ignite.
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Everything will die, Mason.
The only one who understands what this me-...
...-m-means, Mason.
Doctor.
Yeah, I just....
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.
Let me have those.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
What?
Yeah, yeah...
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
We've got the real thing!
I'm at mile marker...
Forty-seven.
God!  They're gonna seal it.
Yeah.
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...-lem?
You find yourself wearing a...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
...you answer mine.
Got that?
So you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
That's not the way I...
Lying?
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...public drunkenness....
...beer.
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...to talk, son.
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me son.
Then how about if I call you ass-...
What is that?
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Let me see your...
...hands!
Pappas!  Move the car!
I said let me see your hands now!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
...stole a truck under arrest.
Now raise 'em!
Listen, Pappas...
...there's a colonel...
...on the other end of this phone.
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
...side!
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
...we're all gonna die in this...
...tunnel now!
Just go check the temperature.
What the hell was that?
The Army, sealin' us in.
Jesus.
I'll lead 'em out.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Fol-...
Okay, doc.
The usual.  Doc.
Gimme this god-...
...-damn phone.
Talk to me.
Arlo.
Oh.
Look at that.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact Ã» it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
An honest living.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Then these are all new owners?
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
Sir?
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
Always?
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Thanks.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
It doesn't hurt.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Probably.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
I think I gave it to her.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Lou Escobar Ã» he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Would you call him a capable man?
Very.
Honest?
None.
That's too bad.
Too bad?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
What for?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
Why is that funny?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Was he right?
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
His girlfriend?
Yes, his girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Yeah.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
No.
When was the last time?
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
At my age, you tend to lose track...
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
My daughter.
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
How did you find out?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Avocado groves?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
I've got her.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Where is she?
With her mother.
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
What is it?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Yes... I think I can manage...
What does this mean?
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
Haven't the faintest idea.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
How do you do that?
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
How much are you worth?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Oh, my, yes.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Who do you blame for that? Her?
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Just bring your checkbook.
She's just no good.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Ain't worth thinking about.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
They don't kill a guy for that.
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
...No...
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
No thanks.
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
Sure thing.
In the garage.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
Tell her later.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I don't know...
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
You sure this is okay?
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Well you own a lot of land.
Where did you get this material?
The apple core?
How do they do that?
But what?
Hello, Jake.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Summer colds are the worst.
Yeah, they are.
How'd you get past the guards?
You've done well by yourself.
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
Since I made Lieutenant.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
No.
No.
No?
No. It was an accident.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
What are you doing here?
How do you happen to know her?
Isn't that your number?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I want the rest of the pictures.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
I heard it was an accident.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
You accusing me of extortion?
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
And why's that?
What are you talking about?
C'mon I'll show you.
Too late for what?
They only dump the water at night.
I know what he says.
Shut up.  Go on.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Matter of fact I do.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
What for?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
That's it?
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Gittes, stay outta this.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
An accident?
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
Of course.
Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
No.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
No.
You and your husband never discussed her?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Yes.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Mr. Gittes.
Well yes.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
Not that Mulwray?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
Would you like something to drink?
What are you having?
Iced tea.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
That's not his apartment.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
What?
I said I'll drop it.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I don't want to drop it.
I should talk this over with your husband.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
Let me get a shot of it.
Sit down!
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
No. I went riding rather early.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
I'll stop by.
...Just a minute...
Oh... thank you.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
A check?
I got your check in the mall.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Well, how much would you like?
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I have?
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
It wasn't much of a lie.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
But he wasn't killed.
How did you find out?
He told you?
I was grateful.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Why?
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
Unless what?
She's cheating on him.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Did you have affairs?
Did he know?
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Where you were when your husband died.
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
For very long?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
K... Cross.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
No reason.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
No, not for that one.
I don't believe you.
How did it happen?
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
So you married your father's business partner?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Oh.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Over the water department, or over you?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Then it was over the water department.
Oh, yeah?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
You sure shout that?
Of course I'm sure.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
What are you thinking?
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
That dam is a con job.
What dam?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
The Valley?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
No.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Know him?
No, I think I'd remember.
And Hollis knew about it?
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
Is that unusual?
Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
They may not know it but they are.
I'll stay.
Get in the car.
Maid's night off?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
When was the last time?
Why?
It was in Chinatown.
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
Doing what?
As little as possible.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
They do in Chinatown.
Yeah.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
Hold still. Why?
...No. Why was it.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Could you do anything about it?
What's wrong?
Your eye.
What about it?
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
...A flaw...
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
Where?
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
Where are you going?
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
The Albacore Club.
It has to do with my father.
He owns it. You know?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
There hasn't been a lot of time.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Do? To who?
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
Give me an example.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
It's possible.
Including the death of your husband?
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
Okay, give me the keys.
You bastard.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
The police?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
She's not tied up!
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
I am not!
Then let's go talk to her.
She's too upset.
Yes.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
What does it look like?
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
You're insane.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I will if you don't.
I can't...
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
...That's not what I meant.
Sure.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
Going somewhere?
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
What did you do that for?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
No...
What the hell is this all about?
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
What are you saying?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
She's my daughter.
I said the truth!
She's my sister.
I said I want the truth.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
To Mexico...
Back to Mexico.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
I have to go home and get my things.
I'll take care of it.
Where can we go?
...where does Kyo live?
With us.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Okay...
How do you know?
I'm all right.
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
Walsh here?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Sophie.
Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me Ã» so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
Where'd he go yesterday?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
When did you come in?
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
The obituary column?
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
Yeah, Sophie.
Who?
Don't know her. Take a number.
Okay.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
There's just one question.
Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
And Mulwray isn't?
He never even kids about it.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
I'm sorry, I --
Well, tell him I'll be back.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Help yourself.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Hope so. He's working for us.
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when I breathe.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I never was.
I don't understand.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
You're a married man, am I right?
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Yes...
I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
Yes?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Never.
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
What about the water?
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
So how are you, Morty?
Yeah.
Come again?
Yeah.
Who?
Yeah?... I do?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
No, really?
I am sorry.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
Then go home and forget about it.
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Water and Power?
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Gittes.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He did or he didn't?
How did they get it away from him?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
This?
What about?
Apple core?
Good idea!
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
What's that, pal?
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
Not exactly.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
I'm working for his daughter.
She ran away?
Well, you never know, do you?
Why'd she run away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
You don't say?
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
I'm serious.
Shut up.  Look!
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
C-4?
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Fuck you.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
I copy.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
Where's the radio?
Surprise me.
A monkey?
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
You know how the airlines are.
Bags?
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
Go on, fetch.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Tucker?
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
Where are you, Walker?
You're getting warmer!
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
The money!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare idiot line for transport, over.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
Hey, fuck you.
I'm coming out!
The clip's not gonna hold!
She's losing it!
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
What the hell are you doing here?!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
Look, I know--
I did what I thought was right.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
There wasn't time for anything else.
We'll never know, will we?
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
Would you?
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--
What are we going to do?
Give him the money.
I'm going with you.
Not on that leg.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
How're ya feeling?
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
She's tough.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance across. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Sure you can.
There you go.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Nice and easy...
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Patience my love, patience.
That's a virtue isn't it?
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
He knows it well.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say we know it well.
You can stop right there.
Oh, please.
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
The winds are picking up.
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
Hello, Gabriel.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Where've you been?
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't expect you to understand.
I don't understand?
You couldn't.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the only one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I understand you.
Excuse me?
Why are you yelling?
Did I miss something?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Resuscitation?
mouth to-mouth; Which could maybe...
Which could maybe what?
A flare up...
Flare up of old emotions...
Listen to you...  The old mouth-to-mouth resuscitation routine, huh?
From one professional to another, of course.
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Where?
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was our home, now it's my home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
And I can't leave.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
Jess--you look good.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
Hal knows what he's doing.
He doesn't want my help.
He can handle it.
What if he can't?
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Can't do it.
Gabe!?
What are you doing here!?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
How'd you get up here?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
You got to go back now!
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Yeah, let's go.
Let's be creative.
Excuse me?
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
You know me, I'm a night person.
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
What about you?
Don't worry about me, just go.
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
I can't believe you just said that.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Making things real rough for Hal.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Call me sentimental.
Remember the first time we came up here?
Of course I do.
It was great.
You attacked me.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Only kidding...actually I attacked you.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
Yeah?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
A simple yes or no would have done.
Want me to lead?
Cute.
What was God thinking when he built this place?
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Can you see light?
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Get it!
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
We might be able to go that way.
Pull it apart!
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
This rope is sixty years old!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Never
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Jess, c'mon...
Gabe!
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Reach up!  Do it!
Don't let me fall!
Do it, goddammit!
Thanks for holding on.
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
There's no we.  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Time is money -- please.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Take the rope.
I won't do it.  No way.
Take the rope.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Just kidding.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
What about you?!
RUN, DAMMIT!!
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
I burned it.
Never could save a thing.
Where's the helicopter?
What the hell's going on?
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
He'll freeze.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
It's up there, on the Tower.
How far?
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
You said there was a way across.
There is.
He never hurt anybody.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
Travers, you're not running things.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
What are you talking about?
Yeah...
What's your names?
Tucker and Walker.
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
On top of the peak.
It looks like a winding route.
Half a day.
Then where the fuck is!
There.  You blind?
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances to me or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
Go after her.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.
Where's the rest of the team?
Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Right.
Then it's a deal.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even in circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Why didn't you send the money over?
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
What's the delay?
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Don't use my name!
Ask the questions.
You're both with the mountain rescue team?
Where's the third one, Travers?
There, what's that place?
I don't trust him.
Kill him when he gets down.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?
This way.
Then go fetch.
He's alive!
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Is it set?
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
What's the code, Travers?
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
Give me the fucking code!
You got what we need?
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
No names, this is an open line!
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Get off the radio!
Good morning, Walt.
Richard Travers.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
What?
Sixth is faster.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.
Go ahead, say it.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
You like Bach?
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
It's no big deal.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Like what?
Travel...and things.
You like being a lawyer?
You psychic?
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Bottega.
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
Big case?
Yeah.
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
Most of the time.
But not now?
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
You need a vacation.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
When was the last time you took one?
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
How often you go?
Dozen times a day.
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Sure thing.
Annie...it's Max.
Max...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
Kill you!  He's coming to kill you!
Dmitri hired him!  He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  He was stalking you when I dropped you off.  I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
Did you say Dmitri? How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
No, no, wait...
...he's two floors below you.
In my office?
Where are you, what floor?
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Yes!  Stay put, goddamn it!  Don't move from that spot...
Yes.
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
I'm...fine.  Fine.
Jesus...
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
Did better'n that.
Oh, my, yes.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Remember what you played?
The crowd had to dig it.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
'Fraid so.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
What kind of question?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
Lay it on me.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Then let's have it.
Can't say that I do.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking face. Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
I picked up a tail.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.
Wouldn't dream of it.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
No harm done, ma'am.
I was with Max when he got the call.
It's nothing.
Tell me about it.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
Quite an achievement...
Vincent...
I'm in town for a short time.
Of course!
Hi, Ma.
I got caught up at work.
I brought you flowers.
You're gonna cheer up.
He paid for 'em.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
I'm standing right here.
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere.
You're kidding me.
I think she got to you, pappy.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
...oh God, don't shoot me...
What happens if you don't?
He's not paying you one cent!
Vincent Farrell, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Hang on.  Carefully...
He'll keep calling.
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
Yeah?
Thanks.
Hello?
Oh.  Sorry.
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
How long you think this'll take?
Twenty-four minutes.
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
An apology.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
It's home.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
I see your point.
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
You prefer nights?
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Me, specifically?
Why not?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Like what?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
Two, two-fifty.
I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time.
We have a deal.  What's your name?
Max.
Max?  I'm Vincent.
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You always stutter?
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
Home.
I think he's dead.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
You - you killed him?
You cool, Max?  Say I'm cool.
You're cool.
No.  You say you're cool.
I'm cool.
Good.  Help me out here.
With what?
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
The trunk?
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
I don't think I can do this.
Yeah.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
It's a spasm!  Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
I'm trying...
Max.
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
You listening to me?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
Two...
It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
What about that?
I tried it.
How about the thingy next to it?
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
Try some deep breathing.
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps.
You better?
I think so.
What are you doing?
It's a mess.
So?
58th and Central.  You know it?
How long, you figure?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
They're somebody's friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Tonight it is.
You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this...
Are you breathing?
Yes.
What else calms you down?  Candy? Cigarettes?  Sex?  Breathe.
Play music.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
I didn't throw him, he fell.
What'd he do to you?
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
How can you kill him like that?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Who was he?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
I don't know any Rwandans.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
Get rid of 'em.
How?
You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
Please.  Don't do anything.
Believe it.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
Why?
Who's that?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I need the job.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
What's this?
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Yeah.
Another collateral.
What?
I don't understand...
People in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work.  And for you? You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be.
Vincent?
Yes, Max?
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I listen to classical.
Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
I never learned jazz.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
I'm not catching a melody.
Let him go, Vincent.
You mind?  I'm working here.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
Let's go.
No.
What you mean, no?
Max?  What are you doing?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
Show up for what?
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Back-up.
Get rid of it.
Why?
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
She's in the hospital.
You go every night?
What difference does it make?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
Oh, I'm captivated.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
You'd do her a favor.
What the fuck was that?
Limos, huh?
Don't start.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Yeah?  What happened?
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
What happened?
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about my job's temporary
What do you call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
Gimme your wallet.
Why?
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
In case who checks?
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
Dmitri?
I don't get it.
Why me?  Why don't you do it?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
He's gonna shoot me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
How long have you been a hit man?
Why?
In case he asks.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term assassin.
You get benefits?
Paid sick leave?
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
Charlie...
Makes two of us.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
You do impress me, Max.  That you do.
Would you have called her?
Who?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
It's not what you owe me. Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
You had to kill Heller?!
Who's Heller?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
I shoulda saved him 'cause he believed you?
No, not just that.
It's what I do for a living.
Some living.
What's at Union Station?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
One more.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
You're full of shit.
That's what you said...
And you believe me...?
What'd they do?
How do I know?  But, they all got that witnesses for the prosecution look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
That's the reason?
That's the why.  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Then what are you?
...indifferent.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
What happened to you?
As in...?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way low...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Answer the question.
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
None of your business.
...pie in the sky?  Someday my dream'll come...  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're do-in' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
You're going too fast.
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! Shoot...my ass.
Slow down!
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Max?
Let her go.
Credit?
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Hey; I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
The sound of love.
I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
I never told her.
I, uh, I have some problems.
The guy came right at us!
I was only going one way.
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Not testing.  Using.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
Do you still ride?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
You going to warn him?
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy against yourself.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
I better get going.
What was your horse's name?
Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
Switch the charts.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
Really?
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
You saved my life.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Figure of speech.  Could we go?
Frank Abolofia.
The Wolf?
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Uh uh, don't want them to see me.
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Yes.
I noticed.
Nothing is easy.
Six months.  Eleven days.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they found on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind eye to the future.'
Well that's the eye right there. Money.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
I have no idea.
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Some party.
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. Spies.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
You want something to drink?
If my universe had a hub...
I've been reading up on it.
Here it is.  Conspiracy Theory  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Pretty scary, huh?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Who?
Never heard of him.
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Getting rid of my hub!
Uh huh.
Never, but I've been practicing.
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
What are you doing?
Saving your life.
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
Shoot.
So what's the question?
Is this your dad?
Is he dead?
How'd he die?
He's why you punish yourself.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
Did you see the van back there?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
So now they feed us terrorists. To create fear.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Right here in Manhattan.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
You will?
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
You look great.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Not today.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
Connecticut.
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John Wilkes Booth. Mark David Chapman.  Lee Harvey Oswald.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Come on.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Not a prayer.
Is that what they told you?
He gave it to me.
Where were you the day he died?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Because he believed me.
They'll trace it.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
What'd you say?
Where is the subway station, please.
Blue moon...
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.  Now.
I can't promise you anything.
Top pocket...  Go on.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
Now she tells me.
Nick... You up?
No.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
I'm a very patient man.
That's great.  Good for you.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
What's that?
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
Liza!
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
You've never seen her run.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
Thank you.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
Well, I don't know if --
You made your decision yet?
That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
I don't know...
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Whatever.
A dog bit it.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
And you have no idea where he lives?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Why you?
A charming term.  Now, why him?
You got that?
No, I don't get that!
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
The truth shall make you free.
Only on the football field.
We're very specialized.
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
Please, sit.
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
It was.  It was.
And what did I say?
My dog.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Yes, that's right.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
So you'll believe what I tell you next.  Because I need to find Jerry.  And I don't think I can do that without you.
You do recognize it then?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
I didn't know.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Wasn't my idea.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Your call.  Have a good night.
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Yeah, I do.
What do you mean?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
In Rome, I'll bow.
What gave me away?
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
That you come with me.
Yes, sir.
Is it possible...?
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Let's go.
Nick, we can't just --
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Hope there's a cartoon.
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
Tell me.
So?
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
You're --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
I disagree.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
Pepsi?  Tequila?
No, thanks.
Peter sends his regards.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
No doubt.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
You know why I'm here.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
Meaning...
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
First decent idea you've had.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
What?  Why?
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Ellie --
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
Are you threatening me?
It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
What is it?  What's happened?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
David --
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
It'll just take a moment.
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
I don't understand.
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
What?
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
This should be it...
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
You aren't staying?
Right.  Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Thank you?
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
Well --
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
What...
This the right place?
I hope not.
And?
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
Put it on speakers.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Dr. Cullers?
Ellie.  Pulsar?
Nice.  Where?
This is how you see the sky?
It's beautiful.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
Getting very weird.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
It's a civilian facility.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
You want to classify prime numbers?
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
And a hundred mile airspace.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
There is no direct evidence, no.
By our standards... yes.
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
Because I can't.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
I can't move any smaller.
Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
Talk to him.
But what do I say?
Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
Could we hear to China?
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Could we hear God?
Okay, okay... there.
Pensacola.
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
Okay.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
You're not real.  None of this is.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Why did you contact us?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Many others.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
So who...?
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
So we passed some kind of test?
Can you help us?
Traitor!!
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Am I one... or many?
The librarian... or the library...?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
So.  What happens now?
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean.
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
That isn't the way it works.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
No more stalling, Captain.
No.  Please.
Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
You live here.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
I didn't realize I was out.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
That's my girl...  Lights.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
A page-break signal.  A period.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
Some kind of circuitry...?
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
And in return?
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
That's my girl.  Done.
It's so... small.
Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
What's that?
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
Hokkaido Island.
The systems integration site.
Mmm.  Look closer.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
of Hadden Industries.
Why don't you come back with me?
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
I'd say this is slightly different.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
Ellie.  Arroway.
Sounds like a Russian general.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
We could be together again --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
You sonofabitch.
Peter.
You too.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Wait -- hold on a minute --
How long was I gone?
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
What'd she say?
Champagne please.
Make that two.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Spoken like a true believer.
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
How do you mean?
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
I flinched.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Do you love your parents?
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
Did you love him?
Yes.  Very much.
Prove it.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
I don't think so.
Why?
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
In other words.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
If you came back.
Something like that.
And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
You're willing to die for this.
Really.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
What'd you think?
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I don't follow.
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
You cool, Ich?
You all right?  You okay?
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
It's getting late...
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
Ellie --
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
How do you mean?
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
So.  The final countdown.
The final countdown.
Oh.  I brought you something.
Thank you.
You're trembling.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
Maybe that's okay.
What...?
What is it?
Ellie, what is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
I can't do this --
What are you so afraid of?
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Please --
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
-- I don't know --
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
I can't hear this now --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
Hey, all right.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I'm not sure it's come to that.
I do.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
But --
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
In other words.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
Meaning...
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
Short shift?
Connie...
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Give me a break, would you?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
What's the problem here?
Give us a break...
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
Why the hell not?
What happened?
Why weren't you at the platform?
Yeah...
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
Only kidding!
Now look what you did.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which rots... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said You and me
He whispered, but it was him!  I know it was him!
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
But earlier, he was staring up here.  Please, Andy.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
What?  What'd I do?
You slut!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
When are you going to call them?
I can't, Andy.
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Get out!  All of you!
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
Look out for her.  She's tougher than you think.
You're fired.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
You've got a date right here, Andy. This has got to...
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
How'd you get this?
You bastard!
But alive!
Where have you been?  What happened to your wallet?
Hal has it.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
We'll get the paramedics...
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
Gaahhd!  What a cop!  You busted me!  The new one, in the Marina.  She has a police radio scanner. It's always on.  She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again.  She's obsessed.  She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
He was lying.
I thought he was lying.
The same as the first time...
The first two murders.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When he was seventeen.
Yes.  I believed him.
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Know her?
A snitch?
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
Hello, Daryll Lee.
What book?
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
In jail.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Who was the man in the basement?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look solemn?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Where are you, Peter?
You thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...
What's he saying?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
You know I can't do that.
Oh, I think you will.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
You know where.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
No.  Not yet.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something else about you.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  Let me help you...
Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor?  That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick.  So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you?  Death is the only cure for people like me.
Who is this?
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
You're calling me a crank?
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
I think this is number three...
That's an opinion, not evidence...
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
Is he out?
Who?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Because of your phone calls.
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
You called us, Doctor Hudson.
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
Is it an ongoing case?
For months... last October.
How do you know that?
Nothing.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
Work with me.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
He won't.
We'll show that to...
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the real thing.  I don't feel infected.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I know what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
It's anybody connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're fans.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
We've got another one.
That's no surprise.
But it's a different m.o.
Then what do you need me for?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says no dumping.  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and posed... Something's wrong with it.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Who turned off the Internet computer...
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the only space I have left in the world!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is intense.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
Is that it?
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
You're afraid of him.
I'm giving you Clint outside.
Halloran.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Because I'm all you've got.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
What'd I tell you?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
They put  Merry Saks on it?!
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my life!
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest heroes?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
They get fan letters...
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: you make that your little job.  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
What happened to you?!
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
Who's the married man?
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
Maybe you should...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you know it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
Did I say that?
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Well, thanks.
I don't want this.  What are they?
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
He can get into my computer any time he likes!  This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- Son of Sam -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching you, laughing at you.
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
The lock...
It's a woman shot in a car?
She on the passenger side?
Don't hang up!
Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
Is there a phone booth there?
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
He was in my apartment!
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Over here.
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Okay.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Who came in after you?
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Because it's your job, that's all.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Well, you outranked me, Nikko.
God, you're cute when you're mad.
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
Just horseshit luck.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Ichiro --
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Sure.  She likes you, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Order Chinese for us and meet me the library?  Anything but beef.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Honest to God, Ruben!
Tell it to your shrink.
Let's get out of here...
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
My promise.
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
Look at her legs.
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Yeah, everything's different.
Milos.  Get my money!
Good.  Very good...
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody inside the case!
The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. Anything.  You're like some horny little teenager.
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
Helen... excuse me, we...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
You messed with the scene.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
I said you were...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
Right.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
Right.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
She disappeared... shit!
There was no sperm.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Would you step outside, Sergeant?
I'm telling you.  Don't you ever address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and who I tell you to work.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
That's always your privilege, sir.
Sergeant?
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
Oh, maaaaan?!
We could use a little help.
With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
So what have we got?
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
You're damn right I do.
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
Where you going?
Helen Hudson...
What the hell you need her for?
Because I think I'm wrong.
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
Give him thatpompous son of a bitch.
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
You got a suspect...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Or the F.B.I.?
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
Give me Ruben back...
Gaiijin.
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
Spokesperson.
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
You messed with the evidence.
Detective Niccoletti?
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got real problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move you in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Shut-up.
Where does this Sugai live?
I want to go talk to him.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
What's in the box?
So I bring some cheese?
Let's go.  Him first.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
You did great, Ichiro.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
How many men?
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
A wife.  She left.
A job?
As a plumber?!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
Why's that?
You all right?
Call for help.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
We can't lose.
Don't give him any more.
He gets as much as he wants.
Ich said you left.
There was a change in plans.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
Gaiijin?
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
I don't give tours.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
You have a helluva way of answering.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
I don't think so.
She ever pull down her shades?
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
He's on duty.
I paid for that.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I need your help, Joyce.
Where's Ich?
Unavailable.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
I need someone to translate for me.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
You could fake it.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
He's got a reason.
Where's the wife?
You met her.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
What do you chant?
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember saying yes.
I don't remember you saying no.
They want your autograph.
Who am I supposed to be?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
We're in?
The cheese...
You'll get Ich killed.
No one's keeping him here.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Why would you care?
I still think you're a bastard.
What if I chant?
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Can't make you change your mind?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Might be different in New York.
I'd like that.
Save it, I already took the tour.
Guess I'm on a roll.
Time, I've got plenty of.
I'm amused.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
This by this...
Not in that company.
Yeah.
What?
What...?  What if I say no?
Why me?
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Who ever made that.
He was my partner.
He killed a police officer.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Care for a hot dog?
I'm buying.
No onions?
Annie, I need a file.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
Thanks, babe.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
No further.  I'm serious.
Right.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You don't say.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
Fucking A, my friend.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
I saw it, too.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
My name.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
I should be trying to stop you.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
They couldn't do anything for me.
How 'bout the morgue?
No.  I have one more thing to do.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
You're welcome.
The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
Who?
I want a gun.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
You're foreigners.
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Does she have a name?
No.
A remembrance.  A closure.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
Elly...
I think he's yours, now.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Do you know what this is?
Murderer.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
You don't even remember...
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
Could you fill me in?
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Cute nickname, don't you think?
Wrong answer.
Another jolly nickname?
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Magic.
Neither.
Does it hurt?
Because I want you to tell me.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
What the hell are you?
Shelly?
Yes.
Leave me alone -- !
Go away.
Shut up.
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
Fine with me.
I'm already alone.
Don't waste my time.
What's this?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Look.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
I'm Kathryn.
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
That's right.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
Are you okay?
I'll be fine.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
I have his journal.
You what?
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
I know.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
Nothing.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
From who?
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
You had my help, detective.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
do you know Where she is; detective?  do you know how to find her?  Even Where to start?  we will find them.
I have to get to Sugai.
You promise not to say anything?
So what year are you going into?
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
Why not?
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
You a lesbo?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
I read your teen beat manifesto.
You did?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Oh really?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
It's not really important.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
You talking to me?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Please.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
Thank you.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I sincerely doubt it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
How's the water?
About what?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I never said that.
You implied it.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Shut up.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Why not?
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
It's my house.
Need a lift?
No thank you.
How are you today?
Give it up.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I said I was sorry.
It was fine.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
And that's a bad thing?
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
You don't even know me.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
That's none of your business.
I'm busy.
Doing what?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Yes.
And you promise to abide by it?
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
What?
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
No, not at all.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
I'm... I'm alright.
How was your date?
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Okay?
I want him.
What are you reading?
Somerset Maugham.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
You're not gonna start that again.
Sure. Have a good night.
I will.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Need any company?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
Okay.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
Oh please.
What?
You must take me for a real idiot.
I don't.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Yes it does.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I can't win with you.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Lighten up.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
No.
Am I bothering you?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
You know what? I don't take it back.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
I have feelings for you.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
That's not fair.
Why can't we be together?
The families who control the casinos?
It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
I just came to say goodbye.
Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
I think that's for the best.
Good for you.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
How am I a hypocrite?
Please don't go.
Get off me.
Hi.
Hi.
It was perfect.
Hi.
Hi.
Sure.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Yeah, me neither.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why aren't you understanding?
I love you.
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
You don't know how to love.
But you knew this was important to me.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
German.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
wrote a letter to this chick And saying shit about Me.
Any ideas who it could be?
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Greg McConnell.
The football stud?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
I don't think that bothered him.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Are you shitting me?
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  What are you doing
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Outstanding.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the stroke of midnight no pun intended?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Doctor King is my favorite.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What are the boys like?
Those are my letters!
Why tell me this?
You trust me?
I'm in the bath, mom.
Okay.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
What are you scared of?
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Eww. No. That's gross.
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
Are you for real?
I guess. It still sounds gross.
See that wasn't so bad.
It was nothing.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Okay.
Eyes closed.
That was cool.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Is it that obvious?
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
No.
Well do you like him?
I don't know.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Okay.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Why?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
You'd do that for me?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Best friends.
Who is it?
It's Kathryn.
With these?
I don't have to.
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Why didn't you do something?
I don't know.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
He made you give him a blow job.
No.
Well what then?
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
What do I do then?
Well did you like it?
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I am?
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
It's like a secret society.
That's one way of looking at it.
Cool.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
Excellent.
You think he'll like it?
He'll love it.
What are you doing?
Just taking your photo.
I look terrible.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I was just kidding.
I want to go home.
Good.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
And then I can go home?
Of course. I'm not a monster.
I swear.
What are you doing?
You promised to let me kiss you.
But -
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Want to join me?
Some other time, Cecile.
Am I suppose to be this sore?
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I'm sorry.
You think?
No, you were fine.
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
I know.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
That wasn't our deal.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
Don't you want to change that?
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to save me. The trick is to let them think it's true.
Same time next week?
No. This is going to be our last session.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
It works a little.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
My daughter, Rachel.
Yummy.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Good luck, Sebastian.
Would you please leave.
Honey, is something wrong?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Oh baby... oh baby...
Baby?  Right on time.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Jesus!
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
I told you to lock the door.
really drunk And blah blah blah blah blah.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes.
You told her I never said I love you before?
Yes!
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Yes!
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
I'll be in touch.
Who is this?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
No.
Where is she?!
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
One.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Likewise I'm sure.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
It's Kathryn.
No.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said Well what about Ronald
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Outstanding.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
What?
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
You don't mean?
I don't find this very funny,
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
I see your point... though why should I care?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Sounds intriguing.
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
Why not?
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. But I thought high school was only four years. I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
I'll think about it...
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
He knows what he's doing.
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
What are the terms?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Be more specific.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
You can put it anywhere.
Even there?
It would feel so yummy.
I'm working on it.
Loser.
Okay.
You would not believe what--
Shhh.
What's wrong with you?
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Interesting.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
No.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
What's your plan of attack?
But who will they turn to for help?
I'm at your service.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
Pris?
Moving along quite well.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Who are you calling?
Cecile.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
You amaze me.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a laaaady. Do you think I take great delight when I hear - Kathryn is so wonderful. Kathryn is a model child. Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day.  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Yippy.
Who are you spying on?
Take a look for yourself.
That her?
Yeah.
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
Shut up.
Nothing.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
Morning.
So? How'd it go last night?
With who?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
Exactly the opposite.
So what went wrong?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
Where?
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
Where is she?
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Where'd she go?
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
Bad time?
Kind of.
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
You didn't?
Oh yes.
Tell me all the details.
It was... Fantastic.
Oh come on. For her first time?
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Mock, mock, mock.
Some other time.
Excuse me?
I'm not in the mood.
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
And I don't.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
No, I'm not.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Is that what you think?
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Why so nervous?
I've never done this before.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, How do you breathe when she sits on your face? It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her. Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. I'm completely fucked up. I'm completely fucked up. I'm completely fucked up.  Poor fatty never had a chance.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I have a flair for drama.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
You wanted an answer to your question.
What's the point?
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
I thought we should celebrate.
Ronald?
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Well done.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
To my triumph, of course.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Come again?
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Get off me!
Will you calm down?
Fine! Get off me!
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Didn't you hear what I said?
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Get out!
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
And if I don't?
I think you have your answer.
War it is.
I'll do my best.
You're too kind.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
One man.  He must be good.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Well please leave a message that I called.
I need to talk to Annette.
Do you know where she is?
Annette! Annette!
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
It's really important.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
Yes, you already did.
Right after we played backgammon.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
What time is it?
Did she show up?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
You're a lucky guy.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Hey Ronald.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Death.
I want more life, fucker.
Why?
What about E.M.S. recombination?
But not to last.
I am?
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Well, actually
Why are you staring at us?
You're just all so... so different.
Nexus - 6.
Show me something?
Like what?
Like...
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I want to hear everything he said.
Alright.  Go ahead.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Of course not.
You could help us.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Dr. Tyrell?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
He could?
His company made us.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
When do you deliver your project?
Thank you.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
Just thought I'd...
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
What's going on down there?
He's not ready yet.
When?
Tomorrow, he says.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
I think, therefore I am.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
I want to do it.
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Yes...he's my friend.
What was he after?
You got a machine on it yet?
Where do we start?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Garbage man?
Yeah.
I was just about to have my dinner.
She was gonna get away.
I didn't like her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who.
Got it.
He tried to kill me!
Just visiting my patient.
He's seriously disturbed...
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Loose ends?
I don't know what you're talking about.
In there.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Yeah.  I got it.
New York.
A cheap hotel.
I'm here for movies.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called It's a Wonderful Life directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing you remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Water?
What does she say?  The woman.
Your name is John White.
You equipped for random questions?
Okay, but...
Bad dreams?
Tell me about them...
If you like.
Well...
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
Anything but, my friend.
Maybe.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
What are you doing?
You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...
I know all that.
I think we're through for the night.
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
No it isn't.  You are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
I'm...  being...  punished.
We are...  living in their dreams...
Yes?
Not if it works.
The umbrella.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Next.
Number three.
It's okay.  Forget it.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.
My pleasure.
Prosit.
Sorry, don't have the time.
How long you had these guys?
Prosit.
No thanks.
I like you too.
I gotta piss.
I don't know.
Sorry.
I'm doing okay.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
No.  I got a problem.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What's that?
These aren't just...
No rust?
Meaning?
Yeah?
Huh huh.
True.
Nope.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Why didn't you go?
Me too.
Can I come in?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
Do you recognize any of them?
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
What did she want?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
Book the good ones for where?
What shows?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
For holes.
It that mother real?
It's a good job.
Does it eat?
Sorry.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
You the Captain?
How do we get out of here?
He's my collar!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
Why don't you want a message sent?
It's not going to help us!
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
Who?
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
And where is our point of arrival?
It's artificial?
Of course not.
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
Which question is that?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
And no questions asked.
Who asked any?
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
How soon can we get up and running?
I have a schedule...
We were talking about my schedule...
You're going to have to get a new one.
Not an option.
Then you better start swimming.
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Dead.
Hanover, listen...
Shut up!
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
I told you...
Are you apprehensive?
For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Did you clear this?
With who?
Who gives a shit about aft?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Just trying to get to my boat...
Maybe we lost them.
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
I'm not staying here!
It ain't any better out there!
Now look what you did!
I saved your life is what I did!
What other bunch?
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
I'm their ride.
Unless you collected on the insurance...
He's with them.
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
You hear that?
Noooo!
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
I don't know...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
You don't have to be so touchy.
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
I'm not rich people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Anti social?
Self sufficient...
Takes one to know one.
I don't know where it is!
On the side!!
Right... You have a boat.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
The come back kind.
How do you know that?
Takes one to know one.
Like cattle...
You're saying they can think?
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
What's the matter?
The quiet...
What is it?
Looking good...
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
I'd take him to the doctor.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
I'd kill it.
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
Keep tasting...
What?
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
Finnegan...
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Jet ski...there's one left up there.
How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
Right...
You want ME to go up there?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
No...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.
This time, make an exception.
Where's you friend?
He's not coming...
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
Let's just keep going.
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Forget them...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
What did you do the my kids!!
Me??
No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
I'd never get an abortion.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
It would be my child.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Joey...
...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...
Joey...it's okay...
Joey...look at me...
It's okay...come on...
I'm stuck...
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
I don't know...you got what we need?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
Line it up now, nice and easy...
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
Ugh.
I have been.
And what have you come up with?
Man, don't go up there...
One whistle... Start the engine...
She's gone...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Joey...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Joey...
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
Or maybe not.
I mean...where is everbody?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
A passenger...
Where are you going?
Nowhere...
You want some too?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
John...
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
I work alone.
You use your equipment, don't you?
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
I'm sorry.
I can imagine.
Can you?  I couldn't.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
What do you want me to do?
Sit.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
Who is this?
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
Dead.
Oh.
How come you're not on the job?
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
If they are smart, they take naps.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
I wish I could.
Did you cry when your father died?
Yeah.
That's another thing I can't do.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
What?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Like?
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
Hmmm?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
They could clean around the arrangement.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
But then how can you...
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
You're sick, Deckard.
I never felt better.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Ten years.
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
I'll send a cop back for you.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
What difference will it make?
You know what I think?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
What's up?
Bad?
I'll see you in a minute.
Thanks.
Please.
Yes.
Go ahead.
No.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
If she is, the machine works.
Thirteen.
You okay?
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
Five, maybe six.
Discreetly.
I'm John McClane.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
Married.
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
The past six months.
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
It's okay, it's okay.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
So, why didn't you come?
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
Mind if I play some tunes?
How 'bout some Christmas music?
That is Christmas music.
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
It's corny, but I could live with it.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
I'll find someplace.
You're all right, Argyle.
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
No, sir.
Ellis, what have you told them?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
What does he want?
You're very perceptive.
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
Who said we were terrorists?
The code key, please...?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
How did you start the fire this time?
Yeah?  What kind?
How come you were in my truck?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Okay.
Bad for your health anyway.
Who are you, then?
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Go fuck yourself.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
You...you're an American?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
I'm a cop from New York.
New York...
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
Sounds better than nothing.
Hans.  Your Hans.
Put it down now.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
I'm going to count to three...
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
What's your name?
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Hi.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
How long?
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
Then don't waste time talking to me.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Encourage them to be bolder.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Go on.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Yes, you're right.  It will be done.
You want to go home?
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
They would, huh?
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Don't I always?
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Yeah.  How'd you know?
So I've heard.
Where are your folks?
They left.
What about friends?
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Uh, what do I call you?
'Roy'.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
They're all yours, Al.  Good luck.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Thanks...partner.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
We sure did.
Al?  Al, you there?
I'm here, cowboy.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
Roy?  You still with us?
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
Yeah?  What's the odds?
You don't want to know.
They way you drive, I can see why.
I...I shot a kid.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I still feel like shit.
Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
Roy?
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
Bullshit.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
What's it look like?  We're going in.
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
I was hoping you'd say that.
Yessir.
Give me that.  Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
This is --
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
You scared me.
You look... better.
Just better.
Thanks.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
Twenty.
What's your problem?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
What's that?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still here?
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
What makes you think so?
You're all so perfect.
Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
Morning.
Morning.
They can do subtitles.
Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.  There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.
That's the crew. They follow us.
What is it, Choco?
Are you all right?
I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who's the girl?
Where are we going?
On a raid. If she wants to see justice... we gonna take Domino to the Jungle, baby.  EXT. JUNGLE -- NEXT  The El Camino pulls into the entrance to the JUNGLE. The neighborhood of LOW INCOME HOUSES winds upward into the HILLSIDE adjacent to the wall. Ed parks the El Camino next to the curb.  INT. EL CAMINO -- NEXT
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
He killed two children.
We gotta bring him in.
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
I'm gonna kill you, Ed.
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Chinga te y tu mama tambien.
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Fuckin' A! We got a five hour drive back to LA ahead of us.  EXT. MACDONALD'S -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER  Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back PARKING LOT of the MacDonald's. Alf is hosing him down. Domino stares at Choco... admiring his body.
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
So what?
You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
What about your toe?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Did it hurt?
What do you think, dumbshit?
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
What?
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
What happened to them?
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
What!!?
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
Yep.
Hello?
Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'
I don't know.
You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
Yes.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
That's the rumor on the street.
We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal.  INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY
Her car was in the shop.
The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Take us to Vegas.
Now the bitch was getting personal.
Take us to Vegas.  EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY  The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas.  INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT  Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you.  I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.
That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.
Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
Nice to see you again, Edna.
Is that the decoder?
Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.
Mescaline.  INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NIGHT  Domino and the others are all drinking coffee. Alf stares out through the windshield at the GLOW of Vegas in the distance.
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Cunt.
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
It was the beginning of the end.
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
I can certainly think of one more!
My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.
Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.
What the... who is this bitch?  EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT  Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
I was a musician.
Really? Did you play in a band?
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
I... love... Pat Benatar.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.
How did you meet Choco?
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!!  INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY  Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.
I was asleep in mum's guest house.  INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT  Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Hello?
We gotta go to work, Domino.
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
Cool it, Choco.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
No. What's the big deal?
Something is going down. Something bad.
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
What did he say about the arm?
He said... take his right arm.
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night.  EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER  Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Do you know where Danang is?
...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Clean?
Don't blow your nose!
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
But you knew that, right?
He knew all along.
What??
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
What?
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
Yeah?
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
How long they been livin' here?
You hear that question, Garcia?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
How was it?
Not good.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas yourself, Officer.
That obvious, huh?
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
Somebody hit you?
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, plain scotch.
Are you sorry she's dead?
Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Yes.  But do you know?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
How'd she meet Patchett?
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Tell me about Patchett.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It's Lynn.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You fuck for money.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
Look.  I want to see you again.
I don't know.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
It's Bud.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
So you saved her.
Yeah.  But not for long.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
That simple, huh?
Did you talk to Exley?
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
I want to know about Exley.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
We talked.
So tell me about it.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
This business, Captain?
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
Yeah, I hate them.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  He's one year from his pension.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Him and me both.  Fucking Exley.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
They're yours.  Take them.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
How?
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
Homicide?  A detective?
Of course... But how?
How what, Wendell?
How'd you get them to retract?
Give me one minute.
You've got it, Wendell.
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
What work?
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
You know him?
I got to write my report first.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Five minutes.  That's all.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
What was that boyfriend's name?
Look at a picture for me.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
What's through here?
Yeah.  A great big one.
Where are we going?
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
What happened?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
Get the fuck away from me.
How's it going to look on your report?
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  Justice.
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
Why?
She told you?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Dudley.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
Dudley's guys.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
Let's just kill them.
What?
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
Which one are you and which one am I?
You expecting problems?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
At least not anymore.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Lynn.
Ellis Loew.
What about him?
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
Bud...
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
You wanted to meet here?
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
I'm not asking you.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
I don't know him.  Mr...
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Of course...
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. Whatever you desire.
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Thanks, but no thanks.
Against your code?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
No.
That's right.
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
What little studio?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
I got her address.
Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. Capisce, shitbird?
I ain't your paesano, you wop cocksucker.
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
More.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Whose shoe?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
Clean?
Until he gunned down six people.
Anything?
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Just show me where they are!
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Did one of the officers work you over a little?
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  You were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
But you were business associates?
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
And?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
And?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
You're wrong.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Answer yes or no.
I... No.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
No.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
No.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
White's a mindless thug.
No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
His blood's always up.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
Yes, I do, sir.
It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
Why?
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Ed, I want confessions.
I'll break them, sir.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?
No... Where'd the tip come from?
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
Why?
And now you'll provide them.
Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
No.
Something like that.
Really?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
Okay.  I'll do it.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
No.
You're the key witness?
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Throwing me?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
What about you?
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
L.A.P.D.
Shit.  Someone beat us here.
Damnit...
What?
Glasses.
Just don't shoot me.
I need to speak to you.
Give me a minute, will ya?
I want you to follow Bud White.
Even I'm not that crazy.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
You make a mistake?
Yeah.  My whole life.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
What?
It's a simple question.
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
So what's the point?
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
I want to do it right.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What's that for?
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
She is Lana Turner.
What?
She is Lana Turner.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
Decorated?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
No.
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
I'm curious about you.
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
How was I?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You sound like you mean it.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I'll take your word for it.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Some reality.
Why not?
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
You, me and White, huh?
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
I know how he feels.
Where will you go?
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
When?
Right now, before I back down.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
None.  Call it a hunch.
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Officer White?
Under the house.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Hush-Hush magazine.
Is she?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Yeah, it's subtle.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Sid, how are they hanging?
What's he doing here, Sid?
And Reynolds?
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Around.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Shut up!
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
I just called it.
A bootleg...
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
Something like that.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Really?  How?
Yeah.  Me neither.
It'll be our secret.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Brill?
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Oh Jesus.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
They said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Yes.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I just gave him my card.
Um...who's that?
Who are you calling?!
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Why?
Rachel Banks?
What kind of a question is that?
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.
I don't know who he is.
Told by whom?
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
You knew the deal. No contact.
Who was that other guy?
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Who are they?
What do they have to do with this?
That's who they are.
The NSA?
Yes.
You're crazy.
Okay.
Wait.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
What is that?
I don't know what that means.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
I don't know what that means.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
I don't know what that means.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Why are they after me?
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
I don't know what that--
No shit.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
What if--
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
I'll pay you.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
How many years have you been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
Move it.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
We said a hundred.
One-twenty.
Did you call anyone?
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
Look, my wife is understandably--
I called my wife!
I didn't use my name.
I called from a payphone!
I told you no calls.
Sorry.
Oh, I'll bet that threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
How do you know so much?
None of your business.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I was a traffic analyst.
I intercepted phone calls.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
How'd you have the manpower to--
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan every phonecall for target words like bomb or President. We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
Jesus.
Why'd you leave?
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to Ramparts and split.
They come after you?
Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
What do you think?
Looks like Detroit.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
That is one ugly sunrise.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Yeah.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
What's going on?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Where?
Here?!
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Why?
What the fuck?!
Gimme that.
You sure?
You're driving.
Those are Feds.
Oh my God...
That wasn't so hard.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Yeah, I can see where that'd--
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Tell me about it.
Drive.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Drive.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
No he won't.
Goddammit--
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
Listen to you, directly. You're not gonna get near the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
What about newspapers and magazines?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my give-me-my- money idea?
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be looking for those moves.
Well how do I know what they're--
I know. I know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
Listen--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
What if--
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What if--
What if what?
What if we just fucked with 'em?
How?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Reynolds.
No.
Who?
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
How fast can you learn?
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Shit.
What are you dialing?
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
He came in four minutes ago.
C'mon.
Feeling lucky?
Not particularly, no.
Who's calling?
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Anytime.
You got any money?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
I'm married.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Can you help me?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Is that good?
Very good.
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a little about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
It's a little late for that.
I'll say.
What size?
Pardon?
What size?
Eight.  Size eight.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
Remain calm.
I think she'll like this very much.
I know, but--
That's my point.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Because my life is being ruined.
Yes?
Thanks.  Who are you?
The robbery.
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
A report?
That's 'cause I wasn't there.
About what?
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
What kind of trouble.
I can't.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Somebody took my blender.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
No.
Not that I could see.
No.
To buy lingerie.
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, way outa line.  You understand?
Hey.
Not a very good one, but--
Just for the criminals.
Right.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Something bad happened tonight.
I saw a man die.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
It's okay.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
Stacy?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm hearing of--
I've seen it.
Yeah...look--
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I know.
I see her for business.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
It's not real...  That's not me.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Stacy, don't hang up.
Stacy--
I know, but listen--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I know.
It wasn't me.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Is Eric in school?
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things electronically. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.  Please.
Well...yeah.
Stacy--
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
That's okay.
You opened the thing?
That was for Christmas.
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
Oh Christ.
That's gonna end tonight.
It's over.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
It's a brand new card.
Here, you can use this.
My suitcase--
My suitcase is gone.
Don't count on it.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
I don't believe it is, no.
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
It's not?
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
Actually, that's not true.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
It is fish.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Do you like fish?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
When do I get to meet him?
DePinto?
Never.
What answer were you--
Yes.
So you've said.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Other than Brill.
Other than me.
Why would I--
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
He doesn't work that way.
You're not.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Thank you.
Eat your fish.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
Why?
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The mob, Bobby!
All right, look--
You got a minute?
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I gotta go.
Will you hang on just a second.
I know.
You being audited?
For the last four years.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
Bullshit.
We're screwed.
How?
Tell me about Brill.
I can't.
You have to.
I've never met him?
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
I did care how.
This conversation's over.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I don't have a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
I'm sorry about that.
It's not me?
You're a moron, you know that?
Any idea what he looks like?
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Yeah?
Who are you people?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
You're wrong.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't give me--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Fuck you. You may have to what?
He didn't give me--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Fuck you. You may have to--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
My shoe?
Hey!
You're Brill.
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
I have to go lingerie shopping.
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Listen--
I don't under--
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
Brill.
This is bullshit. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
You're firing me.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Fuck off.
Good point.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
That's because your Union bosses are those Guido mother-fuckers.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
Where's Stacy?
What are you talking--
Why?
Hi, dad.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
Dad!
You staying for dinner?
He's kidding.
Where's mom?
She's in the kitchen.
Dad!
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
Who won the fight?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Yeah.
Did you take anything--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
How long can you stay?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
It's okay to use the phone.
Alright!
No 900 numbers.
They took the espresso machine. The espresso machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
Did they take your clothes?
No.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
Why don't you give 'em a call.
What about jewelry?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
The blender?
I love my blender.
No, but they took my blender.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
What?
Serve the ball.
Table 122?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Into what?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Just be cool.
Jerry--
Christ!
Bobby--
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Bobby--
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Calm down.
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Jesus.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Bobby--
They're framing me.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
You're tired.
Jerry--
Listen to me.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
I won't make it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
To the cops?
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I have a family.
So do I!
I'm sorry, man.
No. No, it's okay.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Yeah?
Turn yourself in.
Yeah?
Go fuck yourself.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the main present, it's just, you know, a little--
Are you okay?
Yeah, what's going on?
The police?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
I honestly don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
You would?
What's your opinion?
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars. Revelations II.
It means who's side are you on?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. American buildings. Americans getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
What happened?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
What about the tapes?
We found the originals.
The originals?
There was a transfer.
Who?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
We'd have to--
Get it.
Hiding something?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
He had help.
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name is in the fucking phonebook?!
He's clever. He had help.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
I just meant--
I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his lap. I want the tape and I want him. Now is--
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
We believe?
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes sir.
No sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a six-hundred billion dollar organization! Now goddammit, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
We don't know.
Explain that.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
What about the tape?
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
And if it wasn't?
Do you have visual?
Not yet. He's near M and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
What's your ETA?
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Yes?
No thank you.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Then let's assume I don't.
Now is that clear?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
I don't recall asking your permission.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
The windows don't open.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Bingo.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
You ordering chop suey again?
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Meaning--
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
Mac's signature.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
You got a better idea?
Yeah. Me.
We've got to catch him in the act.
Why didn't I think of that?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
That's doable.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Which you have in mind.
You don't call, you don't write.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
We're getting close.
How close?
I don't know, but close.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
Gin? Where the hell are you?
I'm in the middle.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Too late now.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
I have a question...
Who am I?
That is of no interest.
Why are we speaking Chinese?
Uh. I'm showing off.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
How about if I try humility.
Mr. MacDougal.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
I don't want to waste your time.
I have a proposal for you.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
You have a car?
Uh, yes.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
You disappeared.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Are you...okay?
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
That's good. Terrific.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Excuse me?
I've got something...
I sincerely hope so.
You're not taking me seriously.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
I didn't expect you to be so...
So what?
So alive.
You...you can't.
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
No. Why would I be?
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
I've got something for you.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Not interested.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
The Empress Death Mask.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
It's not for sale.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
But Roki said--
You can't.
Oh?
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
We going somewhere?
Maybe I should drive this time.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Very nice.
You want me to pick up a painting?
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
It's a test.
Fine. What do I do?
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
How much am I paying?
I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
It's a fake.
Give him the card.
But--
Can you follow simple directions?
Look on the back. What do you see?
A film case.
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
He says they turned the card down.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Not funny.
What the hell do I do now?
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
What the hell was that?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
You what--?
It's one way.
We're only going one way.
We're going to die, aren't we...
I'm not the one to ask...
I never carry...baggage.
Those are my clothes.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
You stole my luggage? You--
I'm a thief. Sue me.
Where's my bag?
That's entrapment.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
I don't believe this.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
Lose something?
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
And--
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
I'm dressed.
And good morning.
Good morning.
Nice spot.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
In a week.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
We go underwater?
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
True enough.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
It was perfect.
No one needs anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
No. It's a down payment.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Let's just see how we do.
So you're testing me now?
Let's do it again.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Did I hear a car?
Our equipment has arrived.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
I didn't mean to get personal.
Yes you did.
So how long to pop the floor?
A dozen times.
The lipstick thermal camera?
Got it.
Charged?
Charged. Receiver?
That's it. We're ready.
One more item--not on the check list.
I trust it's your size.
It's---beautiful.
You bought this for me?
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Thank you.
Thank you.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
I've got something for you.
Aren't we early?
Little celebration before we set off.
To us. To the Mask.
To our...partnership.
You're nervous again.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
You were afraid of heights?
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Aren't we all.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
He wasn't.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Something like that.
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
Camera in the--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
In eye of that painting.
We're working.
It's a party.
One, two, three...
You're not on the beat.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Ready?
Ready.
Can you see the other PIRs?
Got it.
They moved it.
Behind you.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Duh.
Shut up.
We did it.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
Okay, you're a thief.
Yes. Yes.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
There is no big job.
What?
A billion dollars.
Your share.
We're living history here.
You don't know the half of it.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Okay, 80-20--
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Hold the record. Alone.
Hmmm...44 long.
I always knew you'd do the job.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
The Mask. Where is it?
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
What about the rules?
My job, my rules.
Well...What are we doing?
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
Transfer.
The eight billion. From them to us.
Right. The eight billion.
What's that?
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
Peoples China Bank.
Where the money is.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
And the money goes--
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
A parting gift from the Empire.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
Got it.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
That's where the Mask comes in.
You've thought of everything.
So how long till we do this?
We're doing it tonight.
You can't be serious.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
There's always a surprise.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Feeling old?
How do I look?
Like a woman of mystery.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
Pulse detectors.
Parachute.
Packed.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
Surgically attached.
No way to take another day or two?
No. You'll see when we get inside.
You shouldn't have.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
There is one more thing.
You have something in mind?
It was wrong to deceive you.
But that's all behind us now.
But would you--would you--
Have really held you under?
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
I'm sorry.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Four billion dollars.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
That's because you grew up rich.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
Not for me.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
They drive so recklessly there.
I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.
The sign of our partnership.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.
Jesus God, it's going through.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
Relax, don't jam it...
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
The disc is still in there.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
The door's the only way out!
I sincerely hope not.
Jesus.
You can do it.
Come on.
No way.
Go!
Hang on.
Get out of here!
I cannot get rid of you.
No, you can't.
Put this on!
I'm not leaving without you.
What's wrong.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
But--
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
My god--
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
He looks familiar.
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
You gave them the eight billion.
You mean the seven billion.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
In the van.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
And you do it so well.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
The key to success is using the right tools.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
You are a miracle worker.
This is big enough.
It's never big enough.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
Right.
Because I never assume anything.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
Black of course.
Oh, it is.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
You look like George Washington.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Because it pays off.
You two make quite a couple.
We're supposed to.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You change partners, you change the rules.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
Tonight your league night?
Check out my ball.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
This is just show and tell.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
To yourself, that's where.
You'll just have to have faith.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
Call it an expression of trust.
Thought you had to use some of these.
You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we think is real--what matters is the art.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
I figured that out.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
My friend, you always surprise me.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
Yes it does.
I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill.
See you.
Probably not.
Yeah. Probably not.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Oh Cuervo...
It's so good to see you again.
He's... near.
Cuervo, look out behind you!
I need a favor.
Don't lie to me.
I got a new deal for you.
I'm already dead.
Say goodnight, Carjack.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
I don't know yet.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Shut up, Plissken.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
That's the deal.
Having second thoughts?
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
Get this crap out of me.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Call me Snake.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Defense against what?
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
Where do I put ashore?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
A medical team will be standing by.
Not you?
Good.
She's in the green.
Locked.
Plissken...?
It's history. I gotta go.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Getting ready to invade.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
Location.
Delgado?
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
Stop the damn car.
No way.
I said pull over.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Where is it?
Right over there.
Where are they going?
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Not yet.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Later.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
How do you know all this?
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Me too?
We'll see.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
I don't know about this thing.
Don't like it, don't come.
Yeah, kinda.
If he lets you get close enough.
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Looking to get out.
Which way?
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Where?
Are you crazy?
What are they?
No screamin' shit.
Who?
Like hell I do.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
How do we get out of here?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
What the hell is this?
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Well, I'll think it over.
I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
I'm looking for somebody.
Yeah.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Hiding?
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
Yes.
I see, your excellency.
Thank you your excellency.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Hello?
Hi
Hi, how'd your day go?
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
Here.
Oh great, anything else?
And you got an invitation.
What's this?
Dinner at the White House.
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Just five or six people.
No kidding.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Why don't you let me?
What didn't he tell you?
Didn't who tell me?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Yeah, well I guess you should've.
What did the doctor say?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Where do you want this?
What is it?
Phonograph.
Storage.
I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.
Sure you won't change your mind?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
No. Not at all,
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Not that I know of.
Groceries maybe? A package?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Oh, I see.
Want to ask him?
Never mind.
Would you like some more coffee?
Please.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked What's this fungus? we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Of course. Have you got a pen?
Oh, she'd love it.
What's her name?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Really? wow.
Thank you.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
All right then we've got clean rats.
I just heard them Karl.
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Karl!!
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
What man?
No thanks Karl.
Morning.
How are you today?
Is it coming out Willie?
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Why the math?
It affects concentration.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
A stimulant.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Depression?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
And those lies she's been telling?
Lies?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Never.
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
She used those words?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
Convulsion?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
So, what causes this?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Are you sure?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Chris MacNeil?
Please go away.
I'm Father Karras.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
Sure did.
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
No.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
On what?
The priest.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
You wouldn't.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I beg your pardon?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Oh yeah, since when?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Why, I don't understand?
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Could you see her?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Like what?
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
What else?
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
It's not important good night.
Wanna drink.
Please.
What do you drink?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Are you sure?
It's fine really, sit.
In Europe.
Have you told him what's happening?
Well I think you should.
What's the difference?
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
She...killed Burke Dennings.
What?
Yes. He's already here.
Is she gonna die?
No.
What did you do today?
What kind of stuff?
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Oh............
When can I have one?
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
Oh look at that.
You like it?
Oh it's so funny.
Hey, where'd this come from?
I found it.
Where?
The closet
You've been playing with it?
You know how?
Here I'll show you.
Wait a minute you need two.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Oh yeah, well let's both play.
You really don't want me to play huh?
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain who?
Captain Howdy.
Who's Captain Howdy?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
He's nice.
Oh I bet he is.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
You think?
Regan, why are you reading that?
Cause I like it.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
I wouldn't talk.
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
I don't know
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Yeah
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Oh I love you.
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Mr. Dennings?
Well you know it's okay.
You like him.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
What?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
I don't know, I just thought.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Okay.
People get tired.
Why does God let us get tired?
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
What are you doing here?
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Oh my God!
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
All done.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Hi Father.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Karras.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
So what's wrong with her?
So what's next?
Oh, Christ.
Where'd you get it then?
I believe you.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Stealing is a sin.
I came to say goodbye.
How's the girl?
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Do you like films?
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Withering Heights.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Another one. Had your lunch?
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Where's Regan?
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
You'd like that?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
Do it again.
No now.
You speak Latin?
Quod nomen mihi est?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Holy water.
Who are you?
Uoy era ohw.
Uoy era ohw.
How's your leg?
Is that too tight?
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio.
No momma.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
No.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Why?
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
There's only one.
But deliver us from the evil one.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Save your servant
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
In the face of the enemy.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
Amen
O'Lord hear my preyer.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
And let my cry come unto thee.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Amen
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
Amen.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
What is it?
Her heart.
Have we met?
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
What's this about?
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Always.
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
I've seen him.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
I once did a paper on it
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, a fall.
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
It's possible. Possible howeverÃ 
Unlikely.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Sick priest, is that it?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
No I probably wouldn't.
Is that a threat?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
That's to bad.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Who's in it?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
I've seen it.
Come on!
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Who?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
I could have you deported, you know that?
Are you tired?
O'Lord hear my prey.
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
...Be gone!!
...from this creature of God!!!
...look down in pity...
Yes.
Sometimes.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm afraid.
Yes.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Are you Detective Williams?
Yes.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
It must be great.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Jeffrey?
Yes?
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yeah. I get it.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
What color is it?
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Yeah.
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
What did he do?
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
... Thanks.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
He's lying.
Where am I?
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
I'm not the same person you remember.
Okay?
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Perfect fit.
Nice-looking kid.
How old is he?
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
And this thing can grow it?
Why would he need more?
Or reactivated the first one.
They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
Pollux ...
So?
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Is Sandy part of this?
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
That's not the worst part.
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
Thanks, Pollux.
For being one helluva guy.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Is that what you think?
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
... I was dreaming ...
Something good?
Must've been after we got engaged.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
So you had a nightmare.
Were you there to catch me?
How come?
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
And you wouldn't be.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
One last time.  It's important ...
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
Is someone there?
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Who is this?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Don't hang up ...
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
How did he expect to do that?
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
I took it from my fake husband.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
What do you mean?
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
Jon, what is it?
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is me. We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Eve ...
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
That's what they always say.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Would it?
Damn right.
How's Loomis?
Go on.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
Which ear was it?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Don't count on it.
Castor?
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was titanically remote.  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Not yet.
You killed them?
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
What are you going to do!
Stay away from my family!
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
What -- what are you doing?
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
Five seconds.
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
Not if I kill you first ...
Jamie ...
Shoot him!
They're too tight.
I'm going to have you fired.
Pollux is -- what?
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Yes? What is it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
I won't tell mom if you don't.
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
What are you -- stupid?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Yeah.
What happened?
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
What?
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
You can't blame me for trying.
Business first.  I went into the Warrants system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
Normally, I would.  But today ...
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
Just following your example.
I had doubts too.  I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What happened to your big assignment?
What do you know about it?
The hospital.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
What is with you tonight?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
-- I've got to study.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Well.
THEN WHAT?
Never before this.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
No. Come on.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No way.
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
Gone?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
I'm not going anywhere.
You always say that -- then you leave.
what?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
... That's great.
You're wearing your suit --
Call me spontaneous.
What's on your mind?
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Great.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
What are you doing?
Studying.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Yes.
Where's Jamie?
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
I'll deal with her later.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
What do you want from me?
I, I don't know.
What do you want?
I'm going to the powder room.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
Yes.
Do you like talk like that?
No.
Lie down on the bed.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright.
I'll go then.
Don?
No.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
It's okay. It's okay.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
See my breasts? See?
Yes.
See my nipples?
No, please. I won't.
Do you like me?
Yes, I like you.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
I made it go down the toilet.
What?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Do you know?
No.
You don't?
No. What is happening?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Then don't talk about killing.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Don't say that.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
OK.
Hi, can I come in?
Yeah, hurry up though.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I, uh.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
I liked being with you last night.
Same here.
Oh shit.
Frank? Can you stand up?
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Nice guy. Who's he?
Who's it, you mean.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
Look.
No.
Falling.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Who is Don?
Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Yes.
Please, please stay.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes. Frank--
Frank is coming?
I sure don't hate you.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
That's good.
Do you like my body?
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Yes.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Does that scare you?
Come on Dorothy.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You what?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
You called me Jeffrey.
Yes.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
I guess I should go.
I want you to stay with me.
I think I better go.
I'll call you.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
You look beautiful to me.
No.  Hi baby.
Yeah, it's me.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
It's okay. It's okay.
Who, Dorothy?
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Hold me, Don.
Don? Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Alright, suit yourself.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Hello, baby.
Hello, daddy.
Mommy's here.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Where are we going, Frank?
Frank?
Yes, but.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Those are my breasts.
If you want to.
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Hello?
No thanks.
I don't want to go.
On a ride.
Heineken.
Here's to Ben.
What?
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
Where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Drop that fucking money!
No Jean, no money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
...Is this a fucking joke?
Unghh... oh, geez...
Certainly -
Certainly.
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!
Nothing.
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
No.
...Would it kill you to say something?
I did.
Unguent.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
I need ...unguent.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Clear him off the road.
Yeah.
She started shrieking, you know.
Jezhush.
Yes.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
We split that.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Well, okay, it's -
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yeah, you already said that.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
Okay.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Yah.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Personal matters.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
...Who's Jean?
My wife! What the - how's -
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
...Blood has been shed.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Three people. In Brainerd.
Oh, geez.
That's right. And we need more money.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
We need more -
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
...The heck d'ya mean?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
GOT IT?
Okay, real good, then.
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here?  You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super -
End a April.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, yah, I know that!
You have children?
Oh, he's adorable.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Mm.
Uh-huh.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Where you girls from?
In what way?
Can you be any more specific?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
And what about the other fella?
Oh, yah?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Uh-huh.
Yah, that can happen.
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Yah, right -
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Yah!
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
Yah.
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
What... What is it all about?
Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
This is it.
...Mr. Lundegaard?
...Brainerd?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
No, I -
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yah, I see.
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
but do you know that for sure without -
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Yah, but -
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
... I'm sorry, sir?
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Sir? Right now?
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
...If it's so damned important to ya!
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah, real good.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, so we're all set.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Yah, how much money was that?
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Okay, real good, then.
Jerry Lundegaard.
Well... yah.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Well, what do ya mean?
What the - how's Jean?
Yah!
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Yah.
Yah.
Be right down.
It's okay, Scotty.
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Shep said 8:30.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.
Yah, okay.
Okay.
Yah.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
Yah, pretty good.
OOOoooh!  His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
lot. It's a limited -
I know it's a lot.
I mean a parking lot.
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
How ya doin', Wade?
What's goin' on there?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
No kiddin'?
We might be innarested.
Yah.
0.104166666666667
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
...Huh?
Stan and I're okay.
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
What time are visiting hours?
Well. Okay.
Yeah?
What?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal.  I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Well, they -
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
You're darned tootin'!
Ah, dammit!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
The heck d'ya mean?
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
...There's a million dollars here!
No, see -
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, that's okay, I just -
Carl somethin'?
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Hiya, Lou.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Well - it's cold, Margie.
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Yah.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
...Well, that passed.
Yah?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Oh, yah?
How's it look, Marge?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
No way.
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
You look in his citation book?
Yah...
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Uh-huh.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Yah?
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Oh...
...Geez.
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah, that's a good one.
Yah.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Oh, yah?
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Yah.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Aw, Norm.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
No, that's okay.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Yah.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Yah, that's me.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah?
Yah - how are you doon?
Oh, pretty good.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
I see that! That's great!
...What can I get ya?
Just a Diet Coke.
...This is a nice place.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
No, no, that's fine.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
I'm sorry.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
No, I didn't...
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
I'm sorry, Mike.
Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...
Better times.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
I always liked ya so much...
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
It's okay...
It's okay, Mike...
God, you scared me.
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Anyone else residing there?
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya?
Hello?
Yah?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Norm?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Linda.
Linda Cooksey?
Oh. Oh, my.
Oh. Geez.
The day of our homicides.
And this guy is...
Gustafson's accountant.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Copy.
There's the car! There's the car!
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Alright.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Love ya, Margie.
Hon?
Prowler needs a jump.
Yah.
Thanks, hon.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're real good.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Oh, fine.
Not on your feet too much?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
They announced it?
...So?
Yah.
It's just the three cent.
It's terrific!
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Yah.
Yah, I guess.
That's terrific.
I love you, Margie.
I love you, Norm.
Yeah, I know.
No. No thank you.
Yeah. okay.
And his wife?
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Oh, my.
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
This is do-able.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
He's at -
Well -
Well... Why don't we...
Yeah.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Say goodnight to Sandy.
Sure.
What?
And I saw you practicing this...
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  ... Mr. Taylor.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
That sounds great!
Really?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
I don't know -- am I?
So far, you have four and I only have two!
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
Deal.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Should we?
I suppose.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
You haven't been going to yours.
Like testicular cancer?
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
What... ?
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
Please.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Good.
Here.
Feel anything?
Make sure.
You feel nothing?
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
I wish I could return the favor.
I could check your prostate.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Whatever.
Chloe's dead.
Do you care?
It was the smart move on her part.
What do you get out of it?
Hear what?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
What is this?  Who did this?
Guy or girl?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
You're afraid to say.
What?
Yeah?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Is this a trick?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
What is wrong with you?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
No.
Well.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I've done you enough favors.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
What?
Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
What?
You are an insane person.
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
Let go of me!
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Tyler...
Why are you doing this?
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it asshole tax.
No, you're right.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
It's getting exciting now.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
Tyler Durden.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
Why?  So you can say, Oh
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
How's that working out for you?
Being clever.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
This is how we fill up our lives.
And, now it's gone.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Delivered from bullshit colors like Cobalt
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
The now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again list.  That list.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Yes, you can.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
They're called cigarette burns.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
like splicing single frames From adult movies into family films.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
Go ahead.  Say it.
Are you feeling okay?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Surprise me.
How do you feel?
But a good strange.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
The fight.
This fight, pussy.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
Anyone.
My dad.  No question.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
What car?
Hemingway.  You?
Any historical figure.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Unbelievable, huh?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You're sure?
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
Promise you won't.
Promise?
How ya doin' Dad?
The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception.
Don't mention me.
A liposuction clinic.
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
Yeah, how did you know?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
No thanks, I quit.
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Fucking sweet.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Homework assignment.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
I asked you what you studied.
Imagine how he feels.
Oh yeah?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.
What else is new? Right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
That's too bad.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Maybe so.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Something on your mind?
What should I have told you?
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your action item list?
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
I want to hear the truth.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Where are they?
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
... is over.
You're too young.  Sorry.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Four in Milwaukee.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Why do people think anything?
Is this really news to you?
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
And, sometimes you control it...
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
The house is rented in your name.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
Um, well... technically, no.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
...stop me?
...to let this happen!
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
This is not about martyrdom.
Green?  Did you say green?
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project Mayhem.
You want out?
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
What?
Defuse the bomb?
What happened to him?
I don't know. He moved away.
One minute.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
What the fuck -- ?
What?
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Why what?
You need me.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
I'm doing this for us.
You will.  You know you will.
What are you doing?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
I've gotta go in.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
What?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
There is no money.
It's free to all.
You're welcome to join our club.
You and your friend.
Pleeeeeease!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're going to die.
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Stuff.  Were the mid-terms hard?
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Yeah. Good bye.
Why?
Animals.
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Yeah, how?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
What list?
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
Signs?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
I hope you're ready for this.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
You have to tell us now.
I...I...
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
You were there?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
Please, what else could it mean?
What about that?
How you doing in there, hero?
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Six duds in a row.
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
Another premonition?
Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
What do you want me to do?
Speed up.
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
What did you see?
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I'm here, aren't I?
No!  It can't be.
I have to save Eugene!
Should we knock?
Holy shit.  He said only new life can defeat death.  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Taken care of.
We need to hurry.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
She had the baby?
Random, sure.
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few Awake magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
You've got a point there.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
What about the rest of you?  Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?
Carter.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Alright.
You've made your point.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
May we come in?
What was the fight about?
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
What's going on here?
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling pile up for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like...
Like what?
You mean Alex Browning.
...My Premonition was just like his.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Clean up?  I don't...
Are you alright?
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
I'm not following you --
Hold on.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
Who is this guy, anyway?
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
Whoa, nine months?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
How do you know?
You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
Stop it, don't move him!
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yeah.
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
I wasn't worried about us.
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
Shouldn't we pull over?
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
I know how it feels to be dead.
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
I know.  I can feel it too.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
So, what's next?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
I can live with thaaaa --
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
Sure.
I...I don't know.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
I know, Dad.
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
That it's not over yet.
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I already know. The Slow Club. It's on Route 7.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
He's not a witch.
It's only the end of June.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
I'm... really sorry.
That's why I was there last night.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
It?
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Is that something you're feeling?
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
This place?!
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
That's him, but... he's not here.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
As in flannels and plaids?
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
Thirty-nine.
Remember the gate number?
No.
Thirty-nine.
Remember the departure time?
Like... 4:25.
0.184027777777778
Right. April 25th.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Most kids do, I guess.
Most kids never have it happen.
Nothing is... anymore.
That sounds good.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Stop the car!
Let us out!
Can't you open the door?!
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Get out! Get out of the car!
Police are coming.
You know what to do.
No! No! Don't!
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
I wish you were on the plane!
Here's to. An interesting experience.
I'll drink to that.
I don't.
Look, there's something you should all know.
Why do you think I was hiding?
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
No!
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
OK.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Okay, yeah, call.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Yeah.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
That's a plan.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
No. I saw it. I saw it!
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Design?
I'm sorry we broke in.
Okay, thanks.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Okay, okay. Bye.
What are you doing?
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Knock it off!
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
Get control of yourself!
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
What did you see?
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
No.
Again.
You stopped.
What's with Mike?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Start over.
Ninety.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Show me how it operates.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
You read me, Brewer?
Home on my strobe.
You okay?
What do you call that?
Batteries not included.
What's this?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
There's a compass in the handle.
Exactly.
No.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
There are no worse places.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
No cigarettes.
Fermented fish sauce.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
We'll check it out.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the yellow man. You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
How you doing, Brewer?
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
American?
Let me see.
Roundeye.
That guy's not going to make it.
I'm getting him out.
You never been in one of those things.
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
You better take off.
Yes.
You comin'?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Forget it.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
It means virgin.  My mother was comedian.
You really got a Masters Degree?
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
How do we get upriver?
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Why's that?
I thought he was with you.
Crazy motherfucker.
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Intelligence work.
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Huntington Beach, California.
Nguyen is good boy.
Okay, Sandy.
Are you okay?
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Why'd they want us?
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Thanks.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Let's go.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
I do?
You think you are... .
Invulnerable.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch Dynasty.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
I couldn't get you in.
Yes you can.
Look, Co...
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
What was that?
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
John.  My name is John.
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
See ya tomorrow.
Stay on your heading, Captain.
That's an order.
You pathetic scum.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
What's the job?
Why me?
Where?
I'm not jumping blind.
What's the plan?
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
All this is for us?
How long have you been setting up?
Nice work.
How long before you're fully on line?
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
You think they'll find any?
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
I know.
Take your time.
Not my people.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
American.  Come to get you out.
Can you walk?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Oh yeah?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah.
Jeffrey? Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
What's your name?
Hello, John.
Mind if I sit down?
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
I could take it or leave it.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Am I out of here?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
This your stuff?
That's it.  My life.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
You're not.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
What did you want?
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Let's do it.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
You worry about me really?
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
Everything okay?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You didn't tell him about me?
No.
Okay. Great!
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
What was that all about?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Where to?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
It's okay.
You look beautiful.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Okay.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Frank!!!
My father has a gun at home.
No.
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Dorothy Vallens?
Yes.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. No. Why?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
I should go with her, Sandy.
Sandy?
Go ahead!
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
No Jeffrey!!
Look Jeffrey.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
You can change it if you want to.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Okay.
What did he bring him in for?
Just for him?
Up where?
Oh fuck!
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Look under the body.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
This is a six-shooter.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Anybody you think is evil?
Yes.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
You sound real remorseful.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
What?
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
You think they sold me out? No way.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What happened?
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
What the fuck are you doing?
I-I'll tip her.
What? What is it?
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
C'mon!
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
Look again for fuck sake!
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Shit.
They got nothing.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
You guys?
We're here brother.
You gotta keep going.
Hello.
Mother, is that you?
Ma, what's wrong?
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
What's my name?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
You don't use shit?
What?! What are you doin'?
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Cause if I do.
How's everything?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Got a wife named Angie.
Who brings it?
Where do you want it?
What's your name, asshole?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
No ma! No!
How's Uncle Sibeal?
What's your story?
Fake it.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Well, I didn't but...
He got off on six.
No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?
Names.
Where from?
What's he do?
Yeh?  Who else?
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Where's he from?
Yeah, I know.
Willie Mays.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
You want some eggs.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Where the hell is it?
Strike out, eh?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Morning.  Sometime.
Yeah, we promise.
Who's on him?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Never trust a nigger.
Not a chance.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
Drink this.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
Who is that guy?
Policy man in Queens.
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
No, you?
He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
Come on -- just for fun --
Monica?  Who's Monica?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Toy wit' this will ya.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
Suspicion of what?
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
We... met them last night.
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Popeye.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Why not?
Let yourself in.
What happened to you?
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
You got the warrant?
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
You want the red or the white?
Pour it in your ear.
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
What about Sal?
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We paid attention in school.
Know any other languages?
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Timezit?
Same car.
Third time around.
Hiya, Jesus.
Whatta you got?
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Pass.
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
Our mother can see through bags.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
You remember Mary Finelli?
You know what I'm saying.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
You're shitting me!
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
How do we get to the vault door?
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Be careful.
I'll call you tonight, afterwards.
I'm alright, Gibby.
It looks open on the other side.
One way to find out.
Hey, bud.
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
Well, why not a little of the King?
You alright?
I think I ruined the sauce...again.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
Did he?
He did.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
We're alive.
Sure.
Frank...what's wrong?
Where's Johnny?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
I love you, Bud.
I love you more.
He ain't the only one.
I'm off.
Wish you weren't.
Do you know how much I love you?
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
The future guy?
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Hey, bud.
Frank...
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Luck, my ass.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Hello, Frank.
Frank, we need to talk...
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
I think you know, Frank.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
About what?
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
What do you mean?
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
I swear, Satch.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Uh, huh.
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
How's that?
Frank, please...
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Deleon.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Glad to hear that.
Okay, start pedaling.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
You ready?
Uh, hello?
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Name's John.
Would someone please come over here and...
me up the...
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What?
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
Hello?
Huh?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
This afternoon?
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you just say?
Oh, that was my kid.
You call your son Little Chief?
Uh huh...
What'd you say your name was?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
W...B...2...YXB.
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What?
29-years ago.
29 years...?
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Aye.
What the hell...
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
I'm not dreaming.
What's going on?
Nothing...I just spilled something.
Oh my god.
What?
You just burned the desk.
What's happening?
That's impossible.
What if it's not...
Dad...?
Johnny...?
How could this be happening?
I don't know.
Sun spot?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
1998
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, Im here at your old desk
It's really you, isn't it?
Yeah...I think so.
No, not yet.
Nah, I gave it up.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
How many?
Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
I think I'm losing you.
No wait, don't go!
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
But you're not...you're not still here.
What are you talking about?
What?
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
Fire.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
It did, Pop.  It did.
When?
October 12, 1969.
But that's tomorrow.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
I don't understand.
Dad...?
Chief?!  Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
Tell me.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Are you alright?
Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What?  What is it?
She's not here.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
She just died, your mother just died?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Shut it. It's Ma.
When?
October 22, 1969.
Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
Murdered?  Why?
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
Whatta you mean...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
What are you talking about?
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
I'll warn them.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
How?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
What are we like in...1998?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Yeah, you betcha.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
Wow.
You there?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
H-hi.
John, you still there?
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
It's not your fault, Dad.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Johnny, I know, but...
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
John, he's got my driver's license.
What?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
He took your wallet?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
We got him!  Dad you got him!
What?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Please, Dad, just do it.
Okay, okay...
I got it.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Huh?
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
Hang on.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
He got beat up by a girl.
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
What's wrong?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
What the hell is that smell?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
Better.
Longbranch...?
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
My father didn't die in a fire?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
Gordo?
You're not looking too good.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
Yeah.  That's it.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
She makes ten.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
What do we tell him about the guns and money?
We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there.
Okay. We're ready.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Uh, huh.
What?
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Yeah.  Sure.
He ain't our guy, John.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Sounds good.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Close.
So how'd you like LION KING?
You work too hard, John.
Look who's talking.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Yeah, that's right.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
She's pretty special.
Are you a good cop, John?
I try to be.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say hello.
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
You used to be on the job?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
Nah, just working the job.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an att --
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?
I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan.
Italian.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
Absolutely not.
No pictures, either.
Destroy all that which is evil...
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
For what?
What?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I'm serious.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I don't know they just always need it.
What is all this they shit? This ain't a movie.
Is that right, Rambo?
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Nervous?
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Better call an ambulance first.
Is that all you found?
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
Whaddya mean?
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Just like on TV.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
...And I said, shut up!
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
Where the fuck are you going?
We'll find it. Just calm down.
No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
What?
Uh...yes.  But...
Okay.  There's one.
It's just beginning.
So what are ya drawin'?
No.
'Cause it stinks.
Come and get it.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
I hope so.
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
Aye.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Oh, we're good man.
Yes, we are.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Will you listen, dammit!
Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Yes, but they released me because...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Yes!
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
I've seen it.
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
So let's talk.
The what?
I'm here.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Yes.
Then what the fuck?
Who did you kill?
Holy shit. Who? How many?
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
It was a community service.
What are you doing?
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Next, you dial a number.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
I'm now begging you.
Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki.
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Randy, c'mon!
Have a good night.
Yeah...
Gotta go.  See you guys later.
Well?
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
Are you crazy?!
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
Okay.
Don't do anything stupid.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
How many times do you want to hear this?
I've told you the truth.
I know what it sounds like.
I didn't kill her!
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
About Jessica.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
She did!
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
Give the guy a shot.
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
A-fuckin'-men!
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the Checkov thing.
And he is one smart man.
He isn't to be touched.
He's a good man.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Yeah?
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
And number three, Dolly.
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
Can she I.D. them?
Of course they were. How many?
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
What?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little...
So what are you thinkin' here?
Really want to know?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
The what man?
The fat man.
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
And the pennies?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Greeks. The Italians.
The Sicilians.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
What about one guy with two guns?
Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
No way they could have seen it?
Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
What?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Why was I not informed of this?
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
There are a few million miles to go yet.
God, even you want to tell me what I can't do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But you did, once.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
Who are you trying to convince?
Now is your chance to find out.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
Sweet-n-low!
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
I'll see what I can do.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
How many bodies, Greenly?
Hello.
Jerome--?
Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
Now you're here.  Who are your friends?
It's about the Director.
Again?
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
What's wrong with him?
Six one.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be you.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do you expect to pull this off?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
I have to know where you come from.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
What about this?
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
More than that.  You'll get used to it.
God, what wouldn't you do to leave the planet?
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
God, you're serious, aren't you?
It's not too late to back out.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure you want the job?
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
You wish.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
Let's get out of here.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
A day or so.
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
You know I'm scared of heights.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.
What are you talking about?
They think I offed the Director.
What makes them think that?
They found my eyelash.
Where?
In a corridor.
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
Come on--we're taking off.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
They'll recognize me.
How could they recognize you?  I don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is mine.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
No way they could have seen it.
I'm sure I could have.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Is that all?
I've got enough on my mind without that.
If you say so.  The stripe.
Good choice.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
You are a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to breed up.  What's wrong with her?
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
She doesn't have to know.  She doesn't want to know.
Where are we going?
Again?
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
You may as well invite her here.
Will you be okay?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
How long?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, How are you?  Forty-five minutes later I reply, Not bad.  How are you?
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
Hello?
I was never very good at it, remember?
How are you, Jerome?
Not bad, Jerome.
How the hell did you get here.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
Who were the victims?
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
I'm travelling too.
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
No bother.
Last night?  I was at home.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about you?  Where were you last night?
Were you alone?
Yes.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
No.
Why don't we say we were together?
Why would we do that?
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
We were just looking.
I know about you.
Friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
Where?
In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
You celebrate, Jerome?
You didn't know?
Yes...yes...
Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
I envy you, Jerome.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
What exactly is wrong?
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
Of course I think about it every day.
Of course.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Why are we leaving?
Those checks take forever.
What about the car?
Let's walk.
Who are they?
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
I can't.
My medication.  I left it back there.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
What happened?
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd rather use a donor egg--  --if it came to it.
But if it came to it then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--what you are?  Don't you get any satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
That's precisely what scaresme--that they won't do anything foolish or courageous or anything--worth a Goddamn.
Oh my god!
when you Go away.
A year is a long time.
Only every time I'm in here.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
What's this, Lamar?
There's a problem, Lamar.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
You gotta be kidding.
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
All it takes is a long arm.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
What about them?
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
I'll take care of my end.
Stay clean.
Hello, McCoy.
Beynon.
News said two persons killed.
Just called ta torture us did ya?
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
And you got him...
That's right.
What about your wife?
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
That's your problem.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
No way. I always do my own work.
I'm in a hurry.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
No applause!
What do you add up to here?
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
We'll try again.
No way. I've got to get out now.
Hello, Doc.
Hi.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Sure...
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
Feel good?
Yeah.
Where do you want to go?
I want to take a walk.
It doesn't look like that.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
What's Beynon got set up?
Small town, small bank, big money.
Where did you get those?
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Good.
Half a million.
What do you want for dinner?
Whisky and a peach.
How does it taste?
Just the way I remembered.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
How's Estelle?
Fatter... some things never change.
Boring.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
No. It's been a long time.
After four years and now the question comes up.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I'm still here, Doc.
I guess I'm kind of...
It's all right.
It's just been a while.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
We promise.
I'll be okay.
Really?
Really.
How was it?
Better than I remembered.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
I bought you a lot of new things.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
Suit yourself.
Is he straight?
You got the parole, didn't you?
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
Yeah... I know.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
That doesn't hurt.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
Want to cry now?
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
Right now.
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Promise you won't laugh.
That bad?
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
At least you were outside.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Bullshit.
I mean it.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
... and live happily ever after.
What about the bank?
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
Doc...
I see it...
They checked in.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
Why?
There are three men dead.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
He might be ready to chop us up.
Do it my way.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Do you trust him?
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
Do it my way.
Why didn't you tell me?
There wasn't any way to explain it.
Yeah.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
She's on TV.
If you don't start telling the truth...
What do we do?
And switched keys.
He must have.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
How long ago.
Sure?
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
There better be a guy with the
You bastard...
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
Texas is a big state.
I can handle it.
I'll bet you can.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
When we had trouble before it was different.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
What do you want to do?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
Do you mean that?
I mean it.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
When they find it, they find it.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Like what?
There may be a hunting party.
I didn't mean police.
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
I think you liked it with him.
El Paso.
That would be the first time.
I did I killed a man.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
You can't trust anything these days.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
Only one car.
Where are you going?
El Paso.
How much?
Twenty eight hundred.
Are you hungry?
Okay?
I think so... I don't know.
No scars?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Yeah.
We're going to make it.
Sure...
I want to say something.
I don't want to hear it.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We got this far.
I guess you're right.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
No more about Beynon.
Whatever happens it's over.
Sounds good.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
I don't see how.
You and me.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
I'll be ready.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Whatever you say.
What is it?
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
So what?
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
You're crazy.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Fuck you!
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
Come on, come on.
Who was it?
Just get your clothes on...
Where do we go from here?
I don't know, airport I guess.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Yeah.
Are we going to make it?
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
What now?
We walk.
That's right.
Where's home?
No, I'm not.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
No, I'm afraid not.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Oh my God.
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
I'll be back at 9:00.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Where?
You were with him?
What about you?
Suit yourself.
Two.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to GollieÂ½s. Okay. Any questions?
What do you have in mind?
Dillinger got killed.
How's Mama and the kids?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Then you do it.
Just fine.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Hello?
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
I kinda doubt it.
Let's just get to the border.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Not now.
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
Come on. How much?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
Sure am.
That's what I want.
You got it.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
Go with God.
Hello?
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
How?
Who?
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
What did you do?  Albert?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
You knew what I'd do.
What happened to this car?
This is my brother's car.
Yeah.
Was the steering faulty?
What about the brakes?
How'd it happen, then?
Was he?
Hurry the fuck up!
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
I know.
I made a mistake.
Never mind.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Yes.
Why?
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Good evening.
That's nice.
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
Yes you can.
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Where's he living these days?
Address?
Doreen.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
I want to talk to you later.
How were things between you and Frank?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Though nicer than most?
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
What was bugging Frank?
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
Liberating isn't it?
Y'know it is, a bit.
What?
Yes, I do.
Who?
No, do you really?
Go on.
No.
While he was here. You went about together?
Was he?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
No. I didn't know that.
So where are we going, Princess?
Of course. Where else?
How'd you know where I'd be?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
And what was that?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Is he coming here?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
What kind of entertaining?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
So?
So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
Not entirely. No.
Sure I'm sure.
I want to give you an Oscar.
Tell me about the girl.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Was it Albert?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Who set it up?  Eric?
Then he must have pulled her.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Now tell me the truth.
And you didn't know her last name?
Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
Nice of you to come.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Have another?
Thanks for coming.
Sorry about your father.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
How's school?
That must be interesting.
You all right now?
You coming to South America?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Well, what'ya do?
Where you going to live, then?
Where's that?
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
What?
Did you work with him, Keith?
That's what I was wondering.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Nobody seems to know.
You work here, Keith?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Where would I find him?
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Large Scotch.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Good lad.
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
Las Vegas.
How many?
Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?
Did they give you a rough time?
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I won't be using the room tonight.
I'm staying with a friend.
It's not like that, luv.
Definitely.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
You sure?
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
I'm sorry.
No. Really, I am.
No, you won't.
Ta-ra.
They came back?
Don't ask me.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
You wouldn't.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Think about it.
No.
Yes, thank you.
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
Do us a favour?
No chance of that.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
Is he?
Eric. Eric Paice.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
It would be. If they were still living.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
That's all right, Eric.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
What the fuck do you mean?
I mean he ain't here.
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
You should have told me who you were working for.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Eh? Have a drink.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Scotch, please.
Yep.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
Yes.
I have to. Things to see to.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
You bet your ass he will.
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
We'll keep going, Roc.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Y-Yes my son.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
What is it my son?
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
God's permission? God doesn't...
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
You believe?
You feel?
Yes.
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
Has he now?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
I guess not.
You're right.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
You know them personally?
Yes.
No. They would never do that.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Forgive me father.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Yes.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Open it!
Have you no fear of God?
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
How long since your last confession, my son?
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Yeah boss?
The... The funny man.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
He says, What's your third wish? And the guys says, I-I want you to beat me half to death.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Did you like your party?
They were friends.
Just a few days.
I can't.
Some day you will.
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Then why do you come to me?
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
The children can stay.
Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
Goddamn bitch.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
Not for strangers; for my country.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Yeah, some deal I made.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Let's go.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
We were all upset about that.
C'mon, I see what I can do.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh, 'scuse me.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I never met them.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
I want you to help me, Fredo.
That's what I'm here for.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
Wait'll you see!
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
What's that?
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
...Who?
What do you want me to do?
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
What is it?  Can I help?
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
And you believed that story.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
It's the way Pop wanted it.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Within the compound will be fine.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
That's off now.
How long does this go on?
Am I a prisoner?
That's not the way we look at it.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
He's not the same as when I met him.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Where's my wife?
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
Hello?
What do you mean gone?
Why didn't someone tell me!
Yes.
I don't know.
Rocco!
Goddamn it, where were you?
Yeah, give me a minute.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Connie's outside.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
Sure, Mikey.
If you need anything, just...
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
If I'm wrong...
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
What was it, so I'll know.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Where's my brother?
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
I asked about Fredo?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
They can come in now.
Wait... there's something else.
Go on, tell me.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Was it a boy or a girl?
Mike, at three and a half...
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
It was a boy.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
I don't know.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
I know he's in Israel.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
That plane goes to Miami...
I want it met.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
They are everywhere!
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Good.  Then you're staying.
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
Twenty-five this time.
Mike wants it.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
No questions.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
You're right.
Tom, what do I do now?
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Yeah, it was once.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Yeah, that was a good break.  A nice deal.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Do you gamble?
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
He is, I believe, a brother.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Senator Kane.
This committee owes an apology!
Yes.
I'm going to the market.
Whose orders are these?
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
Kay.
Yes, Michael.
How's the baby?
Sleeping inside me.
Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, Michael, it does.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
I had no idea...
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Where?
Why don't you sit down?
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Why too late?
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
His brother came to help him.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
You would have killed his brother?
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Kay, I told you...
Goodbye, Michael.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
You haven't heard me.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
The baby I lost...
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
There are still things I have to do.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
No, I meant lose his family.
But times are different...
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
Not for a few years.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
Yes.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
However I can help you...
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
We do favors for each other...
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
Nothing is more important.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
Of course you must keep control of your family.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Enjoy.
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
The money was sent.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
This doubles my investment.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
No, I'm fine.
Very impressive.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
How is his health?
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
Let him gamble.
Yes.
No.
I deny his every charge.
That is a complete falsehood.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
I do not.
I know.
When do we talk?
After dinner.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
You were unfair with them.
Says who?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
They feel cheated.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
I want you to settle on their terms.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
I know.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
Good.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
Turnbull is a good man.
Keep them alive.
It's important.
And?
Rosato, where's your brother?
He don't want to talk?
We worked it all out beforehand.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
The same assurance we got from you.
What if I say shove it?
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
We got no choice.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
We got friends in the commission.
I'm talking about Italians!
He supports me.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
What's this?
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
How's the leg?
What are you doing here?
Six years ...
Tell me about Kip -
What kind of job... ?
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
It seems she neglected to mention it
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Who was the job for?
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Fish.
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of Karaoke.
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
Point-five ...
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Yes ... Kip ...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
I don't want him hurt...
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
I'm not interested --
I knew you'd say that.
I'm just here about my brother.
I knew you'd say that, too --
Sound it out for me.
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
And if he doesn't make it -- ?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
don't want the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
Get out of here, Ray --
One more night --
Get out --
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
Right there -
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Well, that certainly won't do.
What do you mean -- ?
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
You got no choice. It's over.
Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
You know my back -
How's Atley -- ?
Let them go --
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
You know my back.
A little family emergency --
Kip.
And this has what to do with me?
You know my back.
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
I'm on the move -
What do you want from me?
You know my back.
Consider me gone, Detective --
Double-meaning intended --
Who is it -- ?
Needs brightening ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
The other day....
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
Not at all ...
Hey, Donny --
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Peugot convertible ...
Gray.
No. That was Higgins ....
How you doing, man?
Forget that ...
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
And there she is --
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
Dignity...
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
one minute -- !
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
That's a good one, Donny...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
It ain't what you'd call a good sign
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
Remember who my brother is?
How's Kip?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
He's in some trouble ...
You getting my checks ... ?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
Mother -- !
You remember that, Kip?
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
Any more, O -- ?
You guys are through...
Whatcha got left ... ?
Carol. A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
We'll take it.
What do you say, Toby?,
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Don't go there, Toby --
No...
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Hey, Kip ...
Hello, Memphis --
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
You, too
Yeah ...
You all right -- ?
Just hold-on there --
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
You okay -- ?
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Yeah -
I heard you were pumping gas -
Something like that -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Yeah --
Nah. It's a scratch.
Hey, you want something to eat ?
What do you got ... ?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
So what are you gonna do?
About what?
About what?
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
I can see that -
What happened to you?
What?
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
C'mon, man... My demise...  Overreaction
Over--  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
Hey, now -
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
You?
You?
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
Otto called -
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
You hear me?
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
Shadow games?
Shadow games ...
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
Thank-you ...
De nada ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
The family that steals together, deals together...
Dad'd be proud --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Price of doing business...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say paper or plastic?
Having fun, Kip?
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
You okay -- ?
I'm cool.
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
I don't know. What -- ?
Come here --
What?
Come here -
What?
Come here -
I've missed you, man ...
I know. I've missed you, too
Toby...
I know ...
Toby...
What are you doing here?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Where'd you find this one?
Ya gotta keep tabs on your Eleanors, Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
You boost her -- ?
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Move over ...
You okay -- ?
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Sure, man --
You want me to buy her?
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
Where you off to -- ?
No problem -
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
I gotta get my tool --
Now, we go -
Shit ...
Hospital.
He give you an advance -- ?
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Take it back, Freb --
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
We're going shopping -- !
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
How's it going?
Call 911 -
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
What are you doing here?
What's with the look?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
You look like you lost your sheep ...
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
Mitch?
Mitch.
So I was replaced by Mitch?
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
On account of Mitch?
On account of me.
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
A distinction worth noting ...
And here I am...
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
What kind of trouble -- ?
And you got some Italians -- ?
Six or seven...
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her Sway.
Hey -
Hey.
The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
She was the only Annie you could find?
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
I go with you --
That what you want?
Okay.
I always thought you'd follow me up.
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
Very good...
No ...
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
Oh. Okay. Right.
Ready -- ?
Oh, yeah.
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
No. Open her ...
What the hell's that -- ?
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
Deodorant.
So, you seeing anybody?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
I think so... They're just... So ...
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
I take out my slim-jim...
Oh, God...
Slip it in ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
Unlock my button ... ?
The alarms go off ...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
I do ... I cut em...
Cut 'em...
Now... I'm in ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
Let me worry about The Club ...
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
And Tracy's on the move ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...
Where to -- ?
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
You okay -- ?
Yeah ... You -- ?
What are you doing... ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
This time it's for real?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
What -- ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
Bench seats.
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
Hello, Otto ...
You remember Junie?
Of course. Hi, Junie --
Whatever do you mean?
What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
He's gotten involved --
You think it can be done?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
Tell me...
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
The hard part ...
Is he still working here ?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
Some crew you got ...
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
You need him...
No we don't -
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
Okay, then... Otto?
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
Anyone? The significance of Robin 1 on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?
What happened to Sway?
She left...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
How old are you now, Toby?
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say Eleanor lives at such and such...  and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
She soars -
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You know what you got here?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Excuse me --
Tell him. It's okay.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Oh I Him.
Wha?  Me?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Why would I get into that?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
Nods.
Nods again.
I understand.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
Liar!
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
What're you doing? What about the car?
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
What do you do?
I'm in construction.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
What are you gonna do?
Get inside!
My bag. My bag.
What bag?
The bag with the envelopes.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
I'm gonna need some money.
How much?
I don't care. Something's going on.
That again.
Henry.  Wake up.
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Son of a bitch.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Shit.
What are you talking about?
Jezuz Christ!
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Stop! Stop!
Let her carry this shit inside.
It'll be okay.
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
We've got to help each other.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I can't do it anymore.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Never.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
With what?
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
What did he say, exactly?
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
Then you're safer in here.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Just get me out.
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
Where's the stuff?
What are you talking about?
I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Oh no! No!  Noooo!
What happened? You okay?
I got seared.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
I got scared.
What about the schools?
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
Paulie was just talking about him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
What?
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
It's been six months.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
Jimmy.
We did it.  We did it.
Give'm a drink.
I gotta talk to you.
Have a drink first.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Don't worry about it.
There are cops all over the place.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Paulie's gonna make him?
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
What'll I tell Fran?
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Watch this.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
You want the melon?
Nah.
I better call again.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
How?
Yeah.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
Done.
Will you stop.
He heard.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
I can't make any more deliveries.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
You ready?
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
You know what to do?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Tommy  ...
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
The third store down.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
I got dry cleaning.
I don't want them left back.
That's important.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yes I do.
In the corporate offices.
Yeah...
It's what I do.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
I'm Martin Blank.
Don't say that.
Wonderful.
Whatever I can get away with.
Bob...
Okay. See you later.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Really?
What do you want to do?
Then express yourself, Bob.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
I just play my own collection.
How long has it been?
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Ten years, I think. What I miss?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Here is now there. There is here.
Tell me about yourself.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
That's it?
What's your business?
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Okay.
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Where have I been?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
You see someone?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
Are you going to the reunion?
That's part of it.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
It's always the little things.
Yep.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Well, there's not much to tell.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Bad experiences.
You met people.
Bad people.
Bad television.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
What's that?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
That'd be good.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
I'll think about it.
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
Hello...?
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
You're fucking psycho.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
Flowers. That's funny.
As long as I get the laugh.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
You look beautiful.
Okay... Hold on...
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Do you want to get a drink first?
What?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Which would you rather...?
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
--She's not dead---
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
No time.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Like heroin?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like love?
Could be. The physical substance of love.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Yes.
Not the other way around...?
No.
Is it something you've done?
It's something I do...
...About five years now.
Get the fuck outta here.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain Moral flexibility would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called mechanical operations. We sort of found each other...
You're a government spook?
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Jesus Christ!
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
You never could have kept this from me.
I was leaving.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
I'll hide.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
You don't understand...
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
You kill people.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Other people can't.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
How do you know?
I just know.
Say more.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be withholding... and I know where you live.
You know where I live?
We're both professionals, Oatman.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, Well
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Yes.
Mmm.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
What stuff?
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
What else? Say more.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
This is me breating.
You understand the psychology of the job.
No.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Okay.
Up on the right.
What do you want?
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Like a union?
Thank you, no.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
No harm no foul.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
I didn't get into this business to have associates. And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. Loner--  Loner gunman. Get it? On my own. That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
No deal.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Is that right?
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
There you go. I left it blank.
Excellent. Here they come.
Not bad. You?
Hey, Bob.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Those all seem kind of related...
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
I guess.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
Lisbon?
In Portugal, yes.
Well?
I don't think so.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
--Nooo--
That's strictly BÃ“ader-Meinhof stuff.
It was the PLO.
Whatever.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Wait a minute--
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
I love. I kill.
I get it.
Did you see Blank in there?
No...
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Patch him through....
This?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
All of it?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
That's going to cost.
I'll pay.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
They blame you for the compromise.
And they want me to make up for it.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
They were very upset.
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
There's nothing to be done about it.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
Never enough.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
I have scruples. Next.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
Don't forget your identity.
See you next week.
This is not good.
I'll do it tomorrow.
What's it look like?
It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I've looked at it.
You have.
Tell them my house exploded.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
Will do.
I bought a new rug.
That's wonderful, Mom.
It's a place where religious people--
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
Jim?
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
I spoke to your father the other day.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
You have a headache?
I have a headache. You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
Yeah. I guess we did.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Yeah...
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
So what happened to you?
You too.
Debi's house.
No. You drove us here.
No.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
He sells BMW's?
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
It didn't work out.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
How did you get this job?
Wow.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How's that?
I'm a professional killer.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
What is it with this guy?
Was that her top?
The sensitive type.
What?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers - they blame hackers!
Cereal.
Go fix the phones.
Who's that?
And what's he do?
Did you talk to him?
Dead.
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Yeah, mom?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Hmmm.
Revenge.
No. No one special.
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Nah. I don't play well with others.
Shit! Come on!
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
Blow me.
Thank you!
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
That's bullshit.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
Talk to me.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
I found it! I found it!
What's going on?
How did you know that?
Burn!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
It nibbles. You see this?
Fucked if I care, man.
Oh, shit! He got me.
We did it!
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
Yeah! Sure.
I'll give it a shot.
What the hell is going on?
He's not in this class.
I said give me time.
He's not enrolled in this class.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
I'm Crash Override.
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
It has a killer refresh rate.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Yeah. RISC is good.
Crash Override. What was it. Mess with the Best
Yeah.
Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.
Your slave?
And if I win?
Make it my first born.
You're not gonna win.
And you have to smile.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
We need your help.
Do my ears deceive me?
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay, thank you.
Kate, listen.
Uh, hold on...
I have to tell you something.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
I know, I know who wrote it.
What?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
You what?
I didn't know what was on it.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
I'll hack the Gibson.
Shit!!
It's my subway defense system.
Alright, so what have we got?
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
Ready?
Yeah.
Alright, let's boot up.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
I'm trying to help you.
Dade.
Thanks for your help.
Oh, wow, she's great.
Yeah.
You would have looked better.
Wanna go for a swim?
I can't believe they decided you won.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Dreams?
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Excuse me.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Homicidal?
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Gill.
Gill.
Good.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
What's happening?
Cancer?
Colonel who?
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
Never fear. I is here.
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
Die, dickweeds!
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Hello?
Phreak?
You think they're going to bust us?
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
A hacker planted the virus.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
Excuse me?
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
What, it left a note?
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
Murphy kid turn you down?
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
Congratulations.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
What is it? What's wrong?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
Okay sure. What about?
Its about tonight.
What?
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
So?
When did you find this out?
This morning.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Don't get angry.
I'm not angry it's just
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
So?
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
You don't owe me anything.
No, you don't understand.
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
Are you two okay?
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Who's that?
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Look.
You think she stands a chance?
She's not dead!
Is there another key?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
We're trapped in this house.
Brady!
Get back!
Brady!
Shit!
Brady! Come with us.
Go!
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady!
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Can't you find somebody else?
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
You guys always look great.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
How many people in the bus?
How many bodies did you find?
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
I can't sleep.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Do you love me Rachel?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Like a sister?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Like a real sister?
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
Sure it does.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
It's been eleven months.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
I don't want to.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
Hi.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
You bet.
Come on Rachel.
Jamie, what happened?
It was the nightmare man
What?
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Yeah, hurry up.
Come on Rachel!
Coming.
Jamie, wait for me.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Had enough?
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Jamie!
Oh Rachel!
No.
Come on.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Well try dammit!
Rachel!
I've got you come on, go down.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
We'll hear sirens soon.
Then we'll be safe?
Yeah.
No.
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Just do it.
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
Hi.
You knew. You just didn't care.
Don't you mean what you do best?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
I don't know.
Jamie?
Its not over yet.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
This is 132, over.
You got your riot gun?
Go get it.
Get the outside shutters.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
I am. Ben Meeker.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
He's here, Sheriff.
Why?
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
Its true, Sheriff.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
When he makes that call.
He's been here.
How do you know?
This is starting to spook me.
Least I'm not alone.
Is that him? Is that him?
Yes.
Oh Christ. Doc...
They didn't know what they were fighting.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
It isn't a man.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Where's that Deputy?
Be here in a minute.
Where's the radio?
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
How's it powered?
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
It's over.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Thank you.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Sort of.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
What's going on?
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Okay.
Now you understand?
Uh huh.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What?
What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Huh?
You're going to be late!
He shouts, too.
Why didn't you wait for me?
That's not true. Here I am.
We just talked.
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
What time?
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Exploring uncharted territory?
Shit!
I have a place for that.
I forgot my chemistry book.
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Look.
Look where?
Behind that bush there.
I don't see anything.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
He was standing right here.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Cute.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Okay. Bye.
Hello?
Why did you hang up on me?
Annie, was that you?
Of course.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I've already lost it.
Sure, see you later.
Bye.
You still spooked?
I wasn't spooked.
Lies.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Probably Mister Riddle.
He was watching me.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
He can still watch.
What's the pumpkin for?
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Thanks.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
What's this big, big news?
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Annie!
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Get him out of here!
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Come with me.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Lee Brackett.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I'll be here.
Anybody live here?
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Could have...
A man wouldn't do that...
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
What do we do?
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
I'll check back in an hour.
Jesus!
You all right?
Sure...
You have the wrong feeling.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Exactly what do you need?
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
They could be.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
I found the car! He's here!
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Have a good time.
Hey, Laurie...
Hi, Tommy.
Are you coming over tonight?
Same time, same place.
Sure.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Sure.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Sure. Sure.
Yes, I am.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Just watch.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
See you.
...how now
I don't like that story.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Why are they under there?
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
After the movie.
What about the rest of my comic books?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
What about the bogyman?
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
No...
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
The bogyman!
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Right.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Promise?
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
I saw him...
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
What is it, Laurie?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
I'm scared...
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
HURRY!
Are you sure?
Yes.
How?
I killed him...
But you can't kill the bogyman.
Laurie, you come with us...
No! Do as I say.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Of course not.
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
I'm wasting time.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
What did you use before?
That's the idea. Here we are.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Are there any special instructions?
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
I see.
What does that mean?
It means... I see.
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
I couldn't if I tried.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
Pull up to the entrance!
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Move it!
What did he say?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
I'm going to tell you later....
Some museum director disappeared.
What is this, a whorehouse, or are you my wife?
...I was working...
I swear to you...
Yes?  My promotion...?
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
I have not read you your rights.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
Then why did you chose to inform me of it...?
To show...  in my ability to squander.  What one might deem an advantage... that my strength is greater than yours...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
...what hindered you...?
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
Or, perhaps...
...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a growth business.
What have they got you doing?
Orderly.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
...you...
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not last with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
I'm looking for...
He said, and these were his words, he valued our time together, because I was civil.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
Yes?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Why me?
Waal, because your selling'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
...very good.
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
...why?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Now, whyn't you help us?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
We could skip the Gavotte.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his mind
Then who's buying it?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a Pass
You want me to be?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
You said here's what they want you to do.  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or what?  Have you transgressed...?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
...they did it for a lark.
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
Who are these guys...?
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Who would that be.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can you be free....?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And have you found Peace..?
Bad beat today.
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
Evelda Drumgo.
COULD I GET A DRINK,  N'I don't care, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' makework, than be doin' pub'l'relations with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one Hispanic, one Librarian, one Jew, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
C'mon, pal.
All y'got to do is ask...
You want to get married...?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
You're ready now.
I'm not.
That's what you think...
Then you tell me, then.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to Get Me...
And who is they?
...the whole world's out to get you...
How crazy is that.
Well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a big target...
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda you care?  Surrender.
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
How you doin?
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  We want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
I know her by the Back.
...these guy'll back you up.
What, What, I can't hear you...
Are you alright...?
I almost shot the baby...
Who called the TV CREWS...?
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any enemies, that...
...he was wealthy...
...his family has offered a large reward.
...would you excuse me...?
What's up...?
They got that kind of money?
What else did I miss...?
...are they hard to get?
First things first.
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know God?
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Not with any certainty we...
Why did he come back?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
...are you alright, sir...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
Seen what, sir..?
Do it...
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Where was the call from.
Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Waal, Nobody's Perfect... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
If you would see him monument, look around you.
Show me the Pigs.
He escaped...
Have the child taken to bed.
What do you want me to do?
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
..It won't be long now, sir...
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
No.  And...
...yes, if you'll, just step away...
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
I won't take much of his time.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
I... think... he was.... he was touched, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
What reaction?
Exactly.
Please, I do not... I don't want to trouble him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Try Barney Clark.
He is...?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
Before The Change
You should get the kids a dog...
....I hardly think so... after The Incident...
No, no, of course not.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
...here's to child abuse!
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Yes, I did.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd bribe me, to, to, to, release you...?
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a spinal, tomorrow, you wuunt feel anything down there, a l'il pulling is all.  N'I'll tell you what, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta this  stop your heart, an that's you done, an there's an end to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it around...  ...stay with me now, fuss with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a code... move that money to me, he confirms it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Come on, Doctor, then you can sleep...
....what...?
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Why?
'fraid it's too late.
Sir:
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
..I was instructed that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
One moment, and they're at the Seven- Eleven.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What is this...?
He once made me an improper suggestion.
You seen John Brigham...?
...what'm I looking at...?
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a hobbyist...
Yes sir, I saw it.
I am all attention.
I know you did what you could.
Reinstatement to what?  There ain't nobody there...
S'hotter inside than it is outside...even with the air conditioning.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
I'm an orphan.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
I said sometime it gets so...
How's your child?
I said how's your baby...?
Waal...
Give it up, Evelda.
Give it up.
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a note, a farewell note, a suicide note...
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Of course, in his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
I'll have them picked up.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
Why did you look at me that way?
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
...your scar..?
How so?
Yes.  How did you know?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
How could you know?
Darling...
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
Who does not?
I've left my program...
...long overdue.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
I require...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
Where do you live?
She's not the first foster that you've had.  Is she?
Yes.... yes...
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the Government says...
Make them eat the figurine.
...tell them...
Is it necessary to know?
Oh, no, no.  It won't be that long.
Sir, with all due respect....
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's fine, but...
Due respect, you don't, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet soup, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the fingers-- But-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
...get outta my way, you sonofabitch...
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse TaskForce...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
...may be the heat....
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer I'm glad you find me so...
...we were speaking of my father...
...and my need for The Institution...
And how did he do that?
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
Thank you, Cordell.
Why should you care?
ARE YOU DONE?
You don't wish to beg...?
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
You're free...
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the only crime.  I never ceased to hope!
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the word...
I want the same drink.  Cause it did me good... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu God...
Well.  Excellent... I'm...
Our Mister Frendler to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Oh baby, oh baby....
No, that is code-word material, that's what that is....
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a cannibal...
I am no going to show you the secret handshake!
...not to turn around.
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
I don't wanna go out there at all...
...something about my father...?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
...what...?
No.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Trouble is, they all seem to die.
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Give me your gun...
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are expensive...
Fine, thank you, but
...whatever is within my power...
...why are we here in the first place...?
...my love...
I am on the track of...
...what do you expect me to...
Because...?
Because we don't have any money.
The Case that I am working on...
Ask me when we get home.
Yes, but the important thing, as I've said...
I know where he is.
I know where he is.
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
No, y'know, I never doubted it...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
...sadly...
Hey, lost again.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would kill you.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my respects to the great Clarice Starling...
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
No,I get it, this is my Cavalier.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take this...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
Thank you.
Or clear your windshield with it.
...what a lovely perfume.
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin home, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to take her there...
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it fetch
Do you.  What does that mean?
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
...but:  this particular statue...
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a clue...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate time... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who solved the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
...a case, so, so fascinating, so...
What're they on about?
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Brazilian.
...a liaison position...
...I feel that...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
...yes, yes, yes....
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
....that's right.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
...no...
No, I don't think so...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your help, but...
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
If he could overcome... his need for... for self-ratification...
Yes.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
But... but....but.... you're right.  I used it.  To bargain.  For her sympathy...  I used it--to whore myself out--
I don't understand.
That's right.
I want to do something positive...
Yes.
...why?
He was shot...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
And.  I always said, he was a P'lice officer.
But.  He was a night watchman.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his badge, an his timeclock.  N'then they took me off.  I saw... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a delusion?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
But they were not there.  Yesterday.  Is that called a Delusion...?
For the worst hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to capture him?  How terrible for you...
Because we must leave the past in the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
...sir...?
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which must come from strong  strong convictions.   But you shy when I say the name of God.
Yes, then, you're saying that you haven't bid upon these drawings.
I have not, I would not.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was afflicted, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was afflicted before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: embrace it, and you embrace life.... Listen, and you hear the word of God...
Mummy has a special technique called Deep Therapy.
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
I adore anything to do with the arts.
playfully shoves his hand away.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
frowns at Henry.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
breaks down into heavy sobs.
Bye.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Hello!
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
Got an A, Mum!
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
Come on, sit up.
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
Can I go now?
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
steps back.
My name is Gina!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
Who cares!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
I'm educating myself!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
is very angry.
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
Open this door!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!
stands and walks toward the door.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
Love, you can still write to each other.
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
That's enough, Yvonne!
You have it.
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
Look, Mother!
looks down at the ground in front of her.
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I'm so happy to see you!
hurries over.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
Thank you so much!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
gives her a sympathetic look.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
They sent me off to the Bahamas for the good of my health. They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands for the good of my health.
looks startled at the outburst.
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Fruit.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Mummy!
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
Somebody's got to help us!
It doesn't matter.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
I think I'm dying . . .
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
Saint Mario!
Him.
This.
This . . .
That.
That . . .
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
God, yes!
What?
It's so beautiful!
What???
I shall call him Diello.
You're such an incredible woman.
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
John has fallen in love with me!
That idiot boarder?
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
You mean travel by ourselves?
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Poor Father . . .
I need my sodding parents' consent.
I'm coming with you.
Yes . . .
I know what to do about mother.
Mummy!
Mummy!
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
All right, then.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Bye, Dad.
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Are you a dream too?
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
Your wife...?
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Your insight is enlightening.
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
I'm all over it.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
Of course, yes.
The way you just looked at me...
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
I'm stumped.
Bull...
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Okay so... what's the safest place?
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Sure plenty of times.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
What was it?
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
I understand... I won't-
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Just get better okay?
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Must be nice.
What?
Getting paid for doing shit.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
Yeah, how's that?
I have my connections
GWEN?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
I quit. Today's my last day.
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
How much time off?
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Yeah? You and who else?
Someone special.
Bret... what the fuck...?
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed.
Ambrose. I know.
I've been in here before.
Where's Allison?
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
I said she's been missing for-
What's the difference?
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
You could say that.
What's that?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Gwen, my wife's dead.
That was cold...
What?
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Uh... eighty two?
Eighty four.
You win! Okay pull over.
But... I thought...
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
What?
THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
This isn't happening.
In a word? Lucrative.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
What?
Never to put you in my will.
Really? Why?
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan
I only married you for your body.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
You're alive...
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
It's perfect.
Where's my wife?
What evidence?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
No please make yourself at home.
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
Thanks.
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
I don't work here.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
What do you want?!
Ambulance.
Two.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
This game is over do you hear me?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
What's under that sheet...?
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
I surrender...
Wait... what the hell is this...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
Tawny.
What do you mean?
Last week...
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Okay.
Hey, c'mon.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Everything breaks at once.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
Oh, that's fine.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
You must value your independence.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Uh huh.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
About what?
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!
Baby, what is it?
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know you can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I've asked him what's wrong.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
C'mon, kids, let's go.
We don't want to be late for our first day of school.
I could take a cab on the way home.
Here, take this out to the table.
But there's this psycho.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with every day.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
He doesn't have a temperature.
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone much bigger than me.
Thank God.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Whew.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Thanks, Mom.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Where'd he go?
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Neil -- what --
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Neil, calm down.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
What?
What's that?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
Stop knowing me so well.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
But it's what we want.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
And it's a shorter commute.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
We're going to think about it.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
How were we -- were we cool?
Paul Newman in The Hustler.
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
Damn.
What?
Did you hear what he said?
What?
He made, you know, a remark.
Honey, are you okay?
And keep my kids away From his property  who the hell does he think he is?  some nice neighborhood.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh -- great.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
No.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
Do you remember who gave us this?
No.
I hear things in this house,
All new houses have noises.
How long does it have to be a new house?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
No, I'm not kidding you, Philip.
I remember what day you wore that jacket.  It was Monday.  The day you were all day in meetings again?  And had to send out for sandwiches?
Well, what about these?  Do you usually put your carbons in your pocket, too?!
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Barbara Zelman?  I don't believe this!
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At Trattoria Valentino?
There are people who do things because they want to get caught.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
Fuck you, Philip.
I thought we'd be happy here.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
The cab's waiting!
Where should I hide the car keys?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
He wants to see me!
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
Oh baby.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
C'mon.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and Aranson is waiting for me and he knows everything.
Oh, honey.
Everything -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only Lowenthal never showed up for our lunch!  It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some --  Do you smell smoke?
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
There might be some extras in the garage.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
I'm fired.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
That's not the case.
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
Who was that?
I'm having the floor fixed,
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Philip, what are you doing here?
Look, I think we should work things out.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
I think it's time I came home now.
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
What?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- call.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
We'll talk in the morning.
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
Just reduced.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
God, your sister's really hot.
Let's follow 'em.
It's fun.
Shit!
Do you have enough money?
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
What about cable?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
No.
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
I didn't.
Neil, do you mind?
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get Mad magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Oh really?  You've been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
I have a cold.
What did the thermometer say?
The thermometer's broken.
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
And I can't help having a cold.
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
Can we keep him?
A man started the fire.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
You knew a second ago.  Who started it?
a man.
Do you see a man?
No.
No man!  Go to your room.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
It's a double.
Even cosier.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Promise?
I'd like that.
Uh huh.
Really.
You told me Bourne was dead.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Talley.
What'd you find out?
Keep trying.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! Gimme the goddamned keys!
You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
Get on the floor!
What do you mean?
Save it for Bourne.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
I have to tell you something --
It's about Mars --
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
I was there, Dennis!  I saw!  It's like he wanted to shoot that cop.
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Jesus.  What is this?
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
Not if they're looking at something else.
Like what?
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
We're fucked.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
There is no way out.
For chrissake, please!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
What are you talking about?
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
It's over.  We have to give up.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
Never heard of it.
That's not gonna fly.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
We're cool.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
They're fine.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
How about the cop?
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I'm here.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I'll give you these people.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
What?
I gotta piss real bad.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
That you, Talley?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
We been through that.  Forget it.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
Let me come get him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
And what are we looking for?
I want to know about Treadstone.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
There's a million dollars in there, maybe two million.  I'll give you half.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
Who else is here?
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
Use more ice.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
We can take it with us.
Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
Let's talk about Conklin.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
I want to know what happened.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
The cops are comin'!
We don't have time!
What the fuck is that?
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
Fuckin' A.
You mean he left, as in went out the front door?
Shit!  That fuck!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
Can you identify this man?
Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
You have his address?
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
...this is Conklin's computer.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Do you know what his budget was?
Excuse me.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
May I finish?
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
I think you got no choice.
Yeah.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
You said they would be here!
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not talk to them; have them.
Close.
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
Berlin!
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the real FBI.  This one's a fake.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Don't you want answers?
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
Mars?  What are you doing?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
You gotta pee?
Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
Are civilians inside?
Holster your guns!
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
Keep your head down.
Smith!  Wake up!
Just one question.  Please.
Sorry to wake you.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Another minute.  Please --
Where are they?
That's not enough.
Is something wrong with Jane?
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
Louise?
Louise?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Tell her I'm almost home.
What?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
No... It must have been Bourne.
Go.
You have her cell number?
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Stand by.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I know this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
He says that his father's hurt.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
You want me to stick around, I could --
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'm sorry, Ward.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is my crime scene!
Let it go, Captain.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Go, Mickey.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
It's mine.  Talley.
Go, Mickey.
What?
Special Agent Jones.
What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He kills people!
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Why not? It was just money.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
No good options left?
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
No. You lost your way.
Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
The kids are in here!
Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
How about you and your sister?
Where are you right now?
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
I thought they locked you in your room.
Can you get into the office?
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Who is it?
Are the disks still in your room?
They're still in the house.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
Yes.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
How do I reach him?
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
Who are you?
What do you want?
You can let go.
Marlon and Al....
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
She say what time I should call?
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
These disks . . . where are they?
Do you think I'm going to let you murder someone?!
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the real FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got Smith!  I've got Smith!!
I guess we do.
Your phony FBI assholes.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
What happened?
We, who is we?
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Excuse me?
Leave it to me.
Of course.
What do you have, Danny?
And?
It was staged?
Jesus...
Keep going...
Lots of people...
I'll be back.
Who are you?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
We are looking for you.
What is this about?
Let me see your identity card.
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Of course.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Where is your family?
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Let me explain.
Please, I don't use guns.
You want to pay me?
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
How much?
Name a price.
I don't have that much.
How many in your family?
Six.
Who else knows about this?
Show me again...
Ten.
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
Give me it.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes we have.
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
What's happening?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Where is she?
Anything. Strong.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
Their people?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
I speak English.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
I can't, I don't have the men.
What is it?
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
The United Nations are still here.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
What did they say?
Satellites?
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
And what will they do with these satellites?
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
The high command? Our high command?
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
The police are very busy.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
He did.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I will see what I can do.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
Okay.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
You said you had no whiskey.
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
Whiskey?
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Bring back your policemen...
We must go to the Diplomat.
Get in.
Your police are at the gate?
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
Where are they going?
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
When?
Today.
No, sir.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
Listen, you need me.
How so.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
I am on a list! What list?
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
No, I do.
You lie.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I committed no war crimes.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
I led no massacres.
You think they will believe you?
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Very good.
At least.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
What do you mean George?
Let's go.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
What?
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
Of course.
When will they be here?
Give me the phone.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
Get out of this room and get back to work.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Yes...
That's not what happened to your parents.
Then what?
For supplies, you drive.
Just drive, Gregoire.
Are you sure this is the river road?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
I would never do that.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Why sir?
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
You killed them.
Call, sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
Excuse me.
Our cards, please.
You have our cards.
How much?
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
How do you know?
I will give you my house.
Of course.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
They loved you.  And I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
I don't want you to forgive me.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Your brother's here?
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.
Of course.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Homework?
What?
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
No.
We must do something.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
I couldn't help.
You could have asked for a favor.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody. Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
Jean Baptiste!
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
The president has been murdered.
I sent them home. Go and call them.
I tried already. The phones do not work.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
They know you are Tutsi!
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
Paul, don't let them die.
Get in.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
What!
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
This won't do.
It will do just fine.
Any luck?
I'll try.
Because you're afraid!
Has Roger spoken yet?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
How can we help him.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
What about us?
We have been abandoned.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
But who is left?
You could leave, Paul.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
Go to the roof now.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
So where is the lamb?
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
What's the matter?
I have to go out to get food.
Go out! Where?
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
No, no.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
You cannot go alone.
I have to go now.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
A kiss.
I have a confession. When we met...
In Ruhengeri?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
Yes.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
What?
Why?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
Tell me what it was.
A car.
What sort of car?
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen.
A Volkswagen!
I will not leave without the twins.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please, please try one more time.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
A little longer, Paul?
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
No.
I have to stay.
No! Sit down now.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Paul! Then another voice.
We are almost out of water.
We are almost out of everything.
Drop it.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Please do not talk like this.
We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
What's wrong?
I have to go to the Diplomat.
Oh, my babies.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Why?
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Many times.
How dead?
Front. Use your teeth.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
What! Paul storms off.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
What are you doing?
Where has all our beer gone?
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
When?
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
You still should've moved.
The staff, the guests.
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Thank you, Roger.
Why the hurry, Roger?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Who is this Simon?
Where?
What is his room number?
Go downstairs, I will help you.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
I'm confused.
No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
And what's Steven's status?
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
oh
But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw... well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your demise.
So what stopped her?
It's complicated. But don't worry --
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
-- bullshit --
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it inspirational. From some German cathedral a million years ago: Driving the Demons From the Mind.
I'm moved beyond words.
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
It was on my Dad's list of things to do. But the House did him first.
Oh dear.
If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
Looks like we're it.
More to the point. Where's our host?
Oh, for chrissake --
uh; excuse me; just One quick question? how long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
Yeah...something.
Conklin.
More the merrier.
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
-- the Saturation Chamber. Where he wanted to put me.
Don't think it'll be a problem.
C'mon.
What are you playing here, Price?
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
You're not my list.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
-- I'm sure you did.
There must be some other way out.
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Melissa!
Ms. Marr!
What?
Is she alright?
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
Three times, to be exact.
Excuse me?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
Try again.
Where is it??
I don't know!!
I'm sorry --
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
What was he doing here?
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
Oh, really: who?
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
As a tumor.
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
-- fuck you!
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
Yeah, me too.
And I think that's case --
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
Who sent you to Greece?
What's going on in Berlin?
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
'Less the place really is haunted.
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
What's in there?
Nothing.
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to normalcy.
Did it work?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
Left, goddamnit!
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Poor Mr. Price --
Uhhhh...
What?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
It's not going to let us out!
If you know where it is, get there!
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Pritchett, is that you?
Up here --
Pritchett!
Over here!
You called it in?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
And we get this money when?
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
This is nuts.
Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not comfortable with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
I'll meet you down there.
Take the gun.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Best of a nightmare.
Prove it.
Prove it how?
Oh, Jesus....
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
-- the stained glass --
-- yeah, we did that --
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
Is she...alright?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
I'm better than that.
Don't push it.
car keys?
-- what? --
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Why?
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Thanks.
Most fun I've had all day.
You need to get out more.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
I don't think so...
Why not?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
There's always exceptions.
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
No...not air --
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
And then where are we?
You hear somebody?
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
We can do it...
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Where the hell were you?
-- you lose either way, Price --
-- listen to the man --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
-- it hasn't been two years --
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Back where?
Let's try down here...
What are you looking for?
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
Cheery looking bunch.
Better living through electricity.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
That's crazy!
This is the best we're gonna do.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
He's dead...?
We're safe?
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
What --
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
It's succeeding!
All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
Where did it go?
What --
You okay?
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
I don't do groups.
What?
Jesus!
You've got your own TV show?
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
I worry when you get like this.
It's just a nightmare.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Forget it. Last birthday the Manson family Ranch; the year before that: Jonestown.
Don't touch me!
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Haven't they already?
Could we have a word?
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The O.J. knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your Jim Jones Kool- Aid that was exactly that?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
You know everything you do gets me hot.
just not always in the sexual sense.
You're hurting me.
I know.
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Really? Well, let it rip.
-- the sadistic prick --
in the act.
Sleep. Sleep now.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
But it ends up the same.
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
Where is she?
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
Asking the wrong person again.
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- I pose you the same question --
-- and who's next on your list?
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
Jesus!
Question answered.
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
Steven --
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
No...
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house IS haunted.
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
Steven??
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
I was in the middle of --
No... How?
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
No, no, it's just --
What?
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
My wife. Where were we?
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
I think it's something better experienced then described.
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
Maybe if I --
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
I can't remember at the moment.
I'm ready now.
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
He was at the campground yesterday.
So...
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
Even if I give you a million as well?
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
I think...I may have the answer.
What?
I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
House 2, Guests 0.
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as ghosts. This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
Vannacutt!!
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
I am.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
What're you talking about?
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...
Where --
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Sorry.
Good way to get your head blown off.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
What is it??
Something with the power, I don't know!!
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
I was upstairs!
I never saw you --
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Fascinated.
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Well, I don't.
I'll take my chances.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
-- confirming everything we already know --
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
-- no more --
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
We can't wait to be sure.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Please! I need your help.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
Rewind that.
Then who did??
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
Wish I could take the credit, but --
guess we know Where Mr. Price is now.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Oh, no.
Don't know that it does.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Won't do any good.
Why not?
You drive.
Switch! You drive!
-- where? -
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Pritchett, this lockdown thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find reverse on this thing and floor it.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
And you think it's in there?
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Pritchett, what is this core of darkness?
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Blackburn's dead.
Excuse me?
He would have been back by now.
Price!
Oh, dear.
Pritchett: what is going on?
He must've unsealed the room!
How, he's supposed to be dead!
-- hey! --
ten.
-- Eddie!!
Melissa...?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
-- I'm coming --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- hang on --
Suppose not.
What will they tell you?
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
Where are you going?
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
What if it's not who you think it is?
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
There's no choice.
No!
Are you all right?
How's your arm?
Good-bye.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
By freeing them.
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Sure.
I love you, too.
Tell me later.
Can I do it again tonight?
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Don't play games with me, little girl.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Maybe it was Colleen...
Who...is Colleen?
It's going to hurt us!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Yes.
Can you talk to her?
She talks to me.
She's down...
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
Ok...
My angel!
I'm scared!
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Where are we going to go, mommy?
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
We'll get it later.
But you found another choice.
It might have.
H-how long will it take?
Go to your room!  Now!
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
I'm ok mommy.
She says she's lonely...
She's here.
She's hiding.
She's down.  Help her...
Can I have this room daddy?
Sure.  Did you see the others?
I want this one, daddy.
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
What's he doing daddy?
He's blessing the house.
For good luck honey.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
That's great, honey.
I know it's a dream.
You do?
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
I can't move!
Mommy please help me!
Daddy, please!!!
Are we going back to California daddy?
Well, that all depends.
Good night Angel...
Good night daddy.
Mommy!
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
The place is pretty dusty.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Must be...
What's the matter?
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Oh come on...
I just, I don't know...
What will Aubrey think?
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
It's just going to take a while.
To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
Or what she was worth.
God rest her soul.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
What?
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
...set up some more things.
Ok.
The heater's here.
Were you fooling with the power?
No.
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
See that tram coming around the corner?
Yes.
Get on it.
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
So what are you saying?
But do you agree with me?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what do you think it is?
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Who?
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Oh come on!
What about keeping an open mind?
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Whoa there...
Are you ok?
What are you talking about?
A friend?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
How are we doing?
I think everything's ready.
She's gone!
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
You hear me? I believed you.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
Aubrey!
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
I'm fine.
Ok...
Should I...
No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
You don't think I know?
Know what?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
What are you talking about?
Maura, what is this!
We're not going.
Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
No...  NO!
Maura!
Are you all right?
I'm ok.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
You're bleeding.
I'm all right...
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
I think we should do it.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
What about the other five percent?
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Before.
Maura.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
I want to hear it from you.
You must be a Londrigan.
Yes, I am.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
Oh, that's nice...
May I come in?
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Did you know her very well?
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
It was a shame.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
Why?
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
So what should we do, father?
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
A Russian?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
Last week? When?
Come back to us honey!
You must be the new tenants.
And you...are?
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
How can I help you?
What was she afraid of?
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
Thank you.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
Good night.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
This isn't happening...
What...amulet?
Did you remove anything in the cellar!
And you got to him before we could.
I killed him???
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
What are you getting at!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
How long will it take!
It will not take long...
Keep talking!
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
What's going to happen?
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
Yes, they are.
Oh.
And what would you do?
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Not at all, if it can help.
What?
Well what is it!
Why are you here, then?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
So when was I here?
What do you mean?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
No. You never worked Berlin.
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
You never worked Berlin...
No... Jason... please...
I was here!
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
It's me.
Bourne?
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
I want someone I know to take me in.
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Okay, Jason, your move.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Where am I?
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Oh, shit...
Careful...
Why am I alive?
Are you disappointed?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
What's that?
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
We need to get in there.
And the Germans can't match it?
Who's going? Us?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Alright... take it down.
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
What? The tapes?
That's where we came out.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
What kind of problems?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Amnesia?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Believed what?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
If you say so.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
And why is that?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
Is it fresh?
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Vodka.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Alright...
Let's give him half an hour.
So?
Do we know what this says?
What the hell is a Treadstone?
Are we locked up?
By who?
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Are we hacking or asking?
And what about you, anything?
Now how's your memory doin'?
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Yes, sir.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Good.
Sure.
Just after Leland Street.
So far.
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
I had him!
I have to get back.
My partner...
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
Actually...
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Do it again.
But there wasn't any...
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Good.  He's up next.
This murder was in the papers, right?
Yeah.  All over.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
I could say the same thing about you.
Who's playing?
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
She your only sibling?
Twelve years younger.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
That must have been awful for you.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Then change it.
How much closer would you say you were?
I don't remember.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Duggar called him?
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Not really.
It's legitimate.
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
Byrd's dead.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
Why?
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Thanks.
He would have liked that.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Anything.  It's important.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
What time was that?
Who was the last one to see her alive?
We're sure it's hers?
No.
I told her to come.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
First I need a copy of the key.
What?
Good.
No.
That's right.
So?
That's right.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
That boyfriend.  Randy.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
Eight years.
Seven years.
They're all over everybody.
I.A.'s calling themselves the Corruption Task Force.  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or oversights any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
Even the best make mistakes.
What do you want to talk about?
You know what about.
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
You know my plan of action.
To do nothing.
That's right.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  Five hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
He's asking everybody questions.
But he's zeroing in on me.  On us. Everyone's talking about it.
He's just rattling your cage.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
You know I remember that.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
Looks like the natives are restless.
Will?
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
Don't do this, Hap...
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
I'm always all business.
Habit.
I'm not expecting anyone.
What is it?
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
Did you love her?
Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
She was nice.  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
You heard me that time.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
After that she left the party to go to him.
Ran like hell to go to him...
You don't know.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
You're not missing much.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
I was her best friend.
Best friend?
Since grade school.
That's a long time.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
You want me to take you somewhere?
Long as it's fun.
Hey...
Thought you wanted something fun...
You and Kay were like sisters?
Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
No...
I don't know.
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
But you were such good friends...
It was like some big fucking secret!
What was?
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That he was going to take her!
Who?
What was it?
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
No game.
The phone call.  The knapsack.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Oh?
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Down at the station?
She was only seventeen.
I suppose.
Did you have sex with her?
No.
But you wanted to.
You gave her gifts.
Yes.
Yes.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
What about him?
He.  Well, he...
Told you I could write an ending.
There's nothing more to talk about.
But we work so well together...
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
I told you that was an accident!
Then so was mine...
Don't you pull that shit with me.
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
Yes.  Like that.
If you want it to be...
Where's your back-up?
No back-up.
You're not following procedure.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Wild card.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
What about a radio?
What the hell would you call this?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Your what?
We haven't exchanged anything.
Listen to me. He's here.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
I thought you were out of town!
What are you doing in my closet?
What are you doing in my closet?
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
That was heart attack time, Karla.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
There's nothing between Will and me.
Yet. Nothing yet.
Say yes.
No.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
That could break the machine.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
The number's unlisted...
Okay, okay. You're right.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
But, he said he'd try.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
He does work hard.
Then, don't.
Oh!
I'm the King of the World.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
I also promised Tyrell.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Karaoke -- perfect.
Don't even think about it.
No way.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Not me...no way...
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
You get any sleep at all?
Some.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Nice move.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
Karla!
Just kidding.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
They never found the body.
Julie...
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Let him go. I believe him.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
What do you mean?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Be careful, Julie.
I've got to see.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
It's too late for that.
There's no way to lock it.
What do we do?
I don't know...
Come on, you can make it.
Julie?
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
No, you're not.
...Nancy?
Oh, god, it's you --
You're okay. Thank god.
Is he?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Ray, we're just friend.
Why are you being like this?
Ray, I can't...
It's okay.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Will you try...for me, please?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Ray...what are you doing?
Never do that again.
You know me to well.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Ben Willis.
Voodoo.
I don't know.
Wait, it's Nancy --
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
It was one year ago...
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
To get out of Southport?
Right. Now I remember.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Are you sure?
This was not my idea.
What?
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Deep breaths --
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
You sure it's okay with you?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
Julie? What's wrong?
What do you mean, Julie?
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
There was a body! I swear it!
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Did you get help?
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
I guess so.
Why are you doing this to me?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
I trusted you.
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
...Why?
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Rio, baby!
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
You think that's a good place to hide?
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
To a great weekend --
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Come on, it'll be fun.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?
Why? He can't help us.
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, I'm in school and --
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Rio de Janeiro!
No. Yes?
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
So why are you still here?
How's the water?
You don't have to be a jerk.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
And do what with it?
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where'd Estes go?
I'll go find him.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
You collect these to sell, abroad?
He is exhausted.
Drunk again?
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk Ã¹Ã¹	he staggered.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
I'll go up and take a look at the General Ã¹- perhaps sit with him.
Well Ã¹Ã¹
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
Goodbye.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Sleep well.
I think not.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Where's Thea?
On my word! That's what they believe.
Poor Cathy --
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
You are fortunate in your father.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -Ã¹or just because he is one's father?
You have forgotten my last name?
My last name is Pherides.
But one must love a father.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now Ã¹- I don't know Ã¹Ã¹
I felt he did not like me.
I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
She is dead Ã¹ at peace.
It was, the plague
In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
Do you mind if I go with you?
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt Ã¹Ã¹ after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
But that should make you like her.
I can't understand that.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
But the war, the army Ã¹Ã¹ they need you.
We still don't know that it's the plague Ã¹Ã¹
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
How did she die?
I had a notion you had become selfÃ¹appointed chaperone lately Ã¹ why?
And I'm your friend Ã¹Ã¹ but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle Ã¹-
When you make sense I'll listen.
Come Ã¹- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
You're crying. Why?
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Everything's so simple. I like you.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
The General threatened me.
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble Ã¹Ã¹ the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
Well, tell, him.
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
He hates all my race.
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? He stole your mother Ã¹-
It is for that he hates me.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -Ã¹
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it Ã¹- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Yeah, it's her job.
No.
I hope that's the cousin.
They're moving pretty fast.
Why not?
We better go back in.
I was counting on hours.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Goodbye.
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
Tina!
What is it?  What's there?
I need a hand here....
Good morning!
Aren't you off-duty?
Till noon.  This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty.
On your own time?
Happy to do it.
Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
I just made it up.  It means, Get me out of there.  What the hell's that?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
In here.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
Oh.
What about that camera?
What camera?
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
If there is, develop it!
You got it.
Not the drugstore!
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
Right.
How long ago?
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
I can't let you take her out.
You can't stop me.
Mike's out there.
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Untie that rope.
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
What?
You're too close.  Back off.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
I'm going out there.
Hey -- you can't do that.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Got it.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Sailing?
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Every day?
I'm going.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Because.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Okay, okay.
You stay here a minute.
Oh, c'mon.
You heard me.
Pop....
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Not till next year.
Yeah?
You want to come here a minute?
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
I kind of had plans....
No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
Mike?  Is that you?
Pop.  I'm sorry.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Sean's still out there.
What?
Dad, I'm sorry....
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
You said something about a camera.
Did you get any pictures?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
Me neither.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
All of us thank you, okay?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Why? What for?
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
May I have this dance?
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Wait a minute....
Too late, it's written.
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
It came up during the meeting.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
Is that what it is?
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
My ass!
There is nothing to discuss.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Look at that:
The what?
The whale's mouth?
What shark?
And the bad news?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
But you must have something to go on?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
How soon?...
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Do you?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Carcharadon Carcharias.
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
What makes you think there might be?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Probably.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
And sound.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
So there's one around here.
Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Can't you tell?
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
Late.
Do I have to talk to those two?
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Why?
Because they're playing our song.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Fooling around?
Right.
Let's get the kid home.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Mmmm.
MMMmmmorning....
Sean's awake.
Good.
Mrs. Silvera.
Need a ride?
Hey!  That's my boss!
Better yet.
So's a donut.
What're you guys doing today?
Where's my day book?
In the den.
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
One what?  Ah-ha!
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
For me?
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Damn.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
So what did you find.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Santos' place.
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
No.
Terrific.
All summer?
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
I know what you're going to say.
Do you?
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
It was bad, wasn't it.
The goddamn smell is always the same.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
That's great.
Sean's asleep.
What's wrong?
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
What?
What'd I say?
That you were fired.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Because of today?  The beach?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
What're you going to do today?
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
I'll give notice.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
Just one minute....
What're you doing?
Going out.
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
Mike's out there.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
We're alone.
Are you serious?
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
We have to do something.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
I know, I know....
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
It's still a good idea.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Two of them are still missing!
Maybe they are!
Bullshit.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Someone has to do something.
Don't push it this time.  If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Perfect.  Look at this ---
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
What?
Martin, it could be anything.
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
We're gonna be late again.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Yeah?  Then what?
Did you say Cable Junction?
When?
Shouldn't he be at home?
No.  Find your brother, okay?
Some people.
Hiya yourself.
Hang on!
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
How old is your cousin?
Great.
Waiting for Andy.
I will, I will.
Great.
Maybe.
Darn it!
Um... can dad come this time?
You know the answer to that.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
All the dads are gonna be there.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
No.
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Right after, the Kids went out?
What Kids?  Who went out?
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Mike?  Our Mike?
Yep.  Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
I'm going.
Hurry, please.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Be careful....
Anything?
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Happens every season -- someone takes off.  Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
Until we find something.
Oh, great.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
I'm not sure I can.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
No.
I can go out if I want to.
My father has a bad memory, too?
I don't care.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
How was dive class?
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
Eat Cheerios.
Maybe.
No.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Would you take him?
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Len, can I see you a minute?
I think we got a couple of live ones.
Brody's riding his tower.
Oh, shit.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Oh, my God....
What happened?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
He thought he had a good reason.
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
So?  So?
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
Be reasonable, please....
Forget it, he won't listen.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
Go on, you're tired.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
I can get it.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Okay.
I'll need more men to look.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
No.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Thank you.
Want another one?
What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Hope I make it through both.
You will.  I'll see to it.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
I guess.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Yeah.
See you later.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
That macho pompous English --
Okay, bye.
You called, Doctor?
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
How come?
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
I don't like what he does.
It's his work.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Not enough loving.
Get out of here!
They're coming with us?
Where's the rubber band?
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
I don't have a choice.
What do I do now?
Take a deep breath and hold it.
Just put your mask on.
Honey... you all right?
Are you scared?
Yes.
Damn it!
Hi, baby.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
I know, I built it.  I've just never seen it this way.
It's romantic down here.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Please, mom. People will talk.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
That we swim.
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Where are you going?
Up.
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I talked you into this?
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
You all right?
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
Michael...
How the hell did it get in here?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
You're going down there again?
Yes.
After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Here.
What's that?
Bracelets.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Thank you.
Kathryn...
Yes?
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Why do you ask?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Change your mind?
No.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
No, you're not.
... Me, too.
Sounds wonderful.
You want me to stay?
Sean, that's right...
How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.
Me, too.
Mmmm... you smell good.
You don't.
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
They said you'd be here.
What's up?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Okay.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Sure.  Let's go.
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes.  It's faster.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
It's too soon to move him.
So tell Calvin.
Well, that's why you got it.
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
Sure...
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
What? What could he do?
Honey, what is it?
Hydrophobia...
Michael, take deep breaths.
I have to get out of here.
Come on.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
Yes, you can.
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
It's a shark's tooth!
So?
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
What do you mean, we don't?
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
Thirty feet???
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
You wanted to know about a cave?
Somebody better get down there!
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
Come on!
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
How is he?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
... Okay.
That's right.
Who's going to do it?
Me.
I am.  You're not.
But you --
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Only to myself.
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
How long will I be in here?
I don't know. These things take time.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Are you okay?
I'm  fine.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Nobody told me.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Fine.  Have them do some.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Yes, aren't we all.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I thought they were clever.
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
I'm sorry.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
That's preposterous!
You can get killed!
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
No!
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Make a lovely item for Good Morning
I want that shark alive.
So do I, love.
What in hell is that?
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
We're taking that shark alive!
Let's hope he knows that.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Why?
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Afraid I can't do that.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Still sleeping.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Just watch it when he does.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
Thanks for helping.
Not at all.
Why are you?
I like it when they wake up.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
And I like you.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Some miss all their shots.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
That's because I am the shark.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
Brian, he's coming around!
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
Thanks to you.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
How'd it get in here?!
He's big as a bloody bus!
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Cute, Evan.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
She, Mister Hutton.
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
A piece of pie on Sunday.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
I think they'll come out now.
I know.
And big for his age.
When did this happen?
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
Not good enough.
Give me a ride?
Sure.
'Preciate it.
Musclehead?
He's missing.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
Sure.  No problem.
What does that mean for Evan?
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Someone's looking for you.
Hi, Mike.
How you doing, Kelly?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
So, you just get here?
Yeah, from Boston.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.
You like Florida?
Well, wait till you see the rest.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Sure am.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Come on!  Check this out!
This is where to be.  High and dry.
And alone.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
As always.
Herpes?
Why you sonuvabitch...
Sean, do you have herpes?
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
There must be a way to fix this.
Fix?
I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
Besides that.
I don't know, what else is there?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Come on, it's fun!
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
No, think of something else.
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Can hardly wait to do it again.
Told you you'd like it.
Now what's this do?
Goes up.
No...  It can't be.
What, hon?
Let's go, let's go!
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
He's diving!
SEAN!
Hold still, damn it!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Gotta sneeze.
Can't help it... ahh...
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Hey.
Calvin said it was all right.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Aww, can't I keep it?
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
Precisely.
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
Yeah, poor bastard.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Buzz off.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
No, South Georgia.
What the hell's there?
Polar bears in Georgia???
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Oh...
The world's southern most reaches.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
It's large enough...
How. Did you. Know that?
How far away is filter number four?
Five hundred yards.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
I'll go with you.
No way.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
Always do.
That's impossible.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Look great, don't I?
Got a job for me?
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
... I'll go to McDonalds.
How'd you do in school?
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
So was Dad.
Took it this morning.
He needs a haircut.
Just. Like. Jason.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
That's Dad...
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
Who's grown up?
Gee, it's good to see you!
I want to see Kathryn.
Come on, let's go.
Something wrong?
You know Overman?
Don't hurry back.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
She still talking to you?
We're in love.
Sure.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
You'll spoil her.
Thea....
Don't bother Hoagie....
Here's hoping, baby...
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Yes, I did.
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
He was doing his job....
Where are you going?
Nowhere....
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about the Lord works in mysterious ways?
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
No way....
Chicken....
Like mother, like son....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
It sure is good to be home....
It sure is....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
We forgot to stop at the store.
Make a list.
We need milk....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
We need beer....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
Tell Matt he should be here....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
How come it's my responsibility?
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
What the hell are we arguing about?
I don't know...You...I don't know.
No fair, I'm not armed.
Turn it off....
No....
Off....
I have work....
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
Close the door.
They're at the beach....
What's wrong?  What happened?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
But it went away...We would have known....
You knew...?
Sweetheart....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
Where is she?
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
Where's my mother?
I don't know....
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I'm not on vacation....
It'll grow on you.
I like it.  Really....
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
Henny Youngman....
You caught me....
I'd be afraid of losing....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
It's beginning....
Beginning of what?
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
We'll be there....
You make sure they come?
Michael!  This thing working?
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
What did you see? What did it look like?
So you believe me?
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
He knows what he has to do....
Stop that....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I see what you're doing....
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
Are you all right?
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
I'm on the phone....
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
You know my father?
He heard that.
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
Don't be late.
In a minute....
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
It's too dangerous....
I never....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
Dad lives here?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
You're coming, aren't you...?
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I almost forgot....
Thanks for the consultation....
I'll be in to read you a story.
I'll miss you....
Mother....
Sit down, Ma....
You guys must be starving....
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Yes.
Are you hurting her?
No, protecting her.
What?
I want you to give up that terrible job.
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm just getting started....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Dad died from a heart attack....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
Come on, I'll show you around.
I didn't mean to start that....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
You were a monkey....
I'm fine....
How are you doing?
Okay.
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
I'll be all right, Michael.
I see a car.
Nothing out of the ordinary....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
I want you to give up your work....
Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....
I'm not going to quit now....
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
You're not a pain in the ass....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You just got here....
Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
It's late....
Trying to write our report....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
You hungry?
Why'd you come out here?
Why'd you take the boat?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Promise me you'll be all right....
Promise me....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
No....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
You must get bored easily.
Can you just go off...?
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
Flies the plane....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
I always listen to my feelings....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
It could have been an accident....
It was no accident....
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
Depends on where you want to go....
Doesn't matter....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
I can't....
I don't know how....
No one does till they learn....
What are you doing?
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
It's just like driving a car....
Where do I pull off...?
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
The plane's turning....
How do you like flying?
It's wonderful....
Nothing....
I'm fine.
No, you're not....
I'm terrific... Come on....
You promised me a drink....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
A big one....
A big one....
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
You're not going to bet it all....
No!
You'll be sorry.
I have two right feet.
Good.  I have two left....
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I have my own little island.
But it gets cold in winter....
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
That's hard to imagine....
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
I could take some time off....
You're always taking time off....
I like to travel....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
I borrow it without telling him....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
Why?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I'm sorry...I....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
The whole idea is preposterous....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
My journals! Where are they?
I can't....
Yes you can....
I have coffee in the thermos.
I'll get it back next time.
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
Want to go for a little ride?
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
I hope she's a good sailor....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
You got a better idea...?
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
She said it was coming....
Grab your socks....
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Get her started....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Keep it steady....
Aye, aye, Captain....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
Good news travels fast....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
What's that....?
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Can't this thing go any faster?
Come on, Hoagie....
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
What happened?
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
It needs more time to charge.
Matt?
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Still chasing fish?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Inch by inch....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
I wish there was something I could do....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
Stop farting around....
Stop busting my hump....
Try the area around the wreck....
Will you leave me alone...?
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
The females have eggs....
We'll pass around cigars....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
The readings suck....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I made them, man....
I stuck them on, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Hey!
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Put me down....
They won't fight with me....
Put me down, damnit....
Maybe I missed you too....
Where the hell's the beer...?
Bad boy....
I didn't do it on purpose....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
Office of Naval Research has some money....
Forget it....
Money is money....
They put bombs on dolphins....
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
How many?
Stop busting my hump....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
What?
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
Where is everybody?
Down here....
Gave them the day off....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
The shark will get it for us.
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
I don't know shit about electronics....
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
You sure you've done this before?
Lots of times....
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
Shit....
How long have you known Hoagie?
What?
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long?
As long as he's been here....
How long has he been here...?
Who?
Hoagie.
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
What do you know about him?
What's so funny about that?
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Half don't...Bring her about....
I am...You must know something about him....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
We lost it....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Maybe it's gone....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
I'm coming...How close is it?
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
I didn't ask you to....
I'm going down, Jake....
You getting a reading on them?
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
How come only me?
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'A Moray eel....'
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
Shit....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Shove it....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Stop that!
You don't like my voice...?
I don't like the song.
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Screw you, Jake....
Holy Christ....
Mom....
What the hell are you doing?
I've got to get to her....
What?
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
All the time....
It'll work....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
I forgot my rubber gloves.  Let's do it.
Your equipment has crapped out again....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
I'll do it, Jake.
It's my fault...I have to....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Who grows more beautiful....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Happy birthday, darling. ...
She's in management....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
Here you go, baby.
Huh?
Woman has taste....
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
How about any guys on your staff?
Did you bring it with you?
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
You heard. Look for the knife.
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a tourist.
Welcome to Eureka.
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - this is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
What about that kid, Ross?
What do you think?
I think you're here all day.
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
The dogs?
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
Yeah, he can go ...
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
Who is who?
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
Not for me ..
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is French champagne.
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
How's the new residence?
O.K.
Not too good in daylight ..
C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is God's Country
What time is it?
Seven thirty-five .. Here, Town Gets Top Cop. I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Why so coy about the word frozen?
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
It's an unsolved. They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
It's a method for quitting smoking.
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
You want my advice?
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that bye-bye. Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
I am stopping smoking ...
How'd you do it, old man?
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
What do you mean, Ross?
Why don't you dump the Fat Lady?
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
No you don't. That's how you think you feel about him. That's how you feel about yourself. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for you.
Oh God... what did we do?
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Thank Christ we got a witness.
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
What? She's blind, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
No, you didn't.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
So am I. But where's my money?
Pay me, and I shut up.
I haven't got it.
Why?
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
I had one puff on a pipe.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called cash.
What do you want it for?
To throw out of the window.
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
You want me to stop the car?
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over Jennifer for months?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
Listen to me saying what?
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
For a dead dog?
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is Jennifer Eight.
That isn't what you said before.
I was wrong.
You believe me, don't you?
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
Did he shut you down?
All but .. How you doing?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Did I say he did?
You looked like you did?
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
Stop it.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For nothing, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, fuck it. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
She wasn't lying about the van.
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been any van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's blind, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
Sure.
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my Nervous Tick ...
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? Good-bye
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
You don't really believe this?
Well .. I didn't know that ..
No .. You didn't know that ..
How the hell do I know who? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
I'm sorry.
Ease off, John ..
I'm sick of this toy town shit.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
What about Citrine?
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
That's just what I wanna find out.
Jesus. What are you doin?
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
What exactly you doing, John?
I'm going up to the institute.
Now?
Listen, you don't havta come?
Hey ..
Where's your watch?
I guess by the bed.
It's twenty of three.
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Bits.
What d'you mean, bits.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
Damn. Your dad did this?
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
Hit those wipers, Ross.
What if we need a back up?
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
You ain't going in alone?
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
What is that?
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
How do you know her hair's black?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think Jennifer
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
I thought it was Taylor's case?
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
What do you want me to do, Chief?
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is right now, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
I deserve a lot worse.
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
Then where's the body? .. Where's the body, and why's he hidden it?
He hasn't hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
Have you got a match on the bullet?
No.
Have you got a print from the hand?
No, Sir.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - and a bill for seventeen dollars for its wig!
I'm shutting you down on this blind thing
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Once.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
That's bullshit,
He says, you freaked one of em out?  Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see
I never asked if he could see. I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
No.
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Coz I'm short of men & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - you get ..
I'll sign anything you want. Please. Bring here her .. I want Helena here ..
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
I am calm .. I am calm ..
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Is this normal?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Duck, here they come.
Maybe he's lying to you?
How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
Vehicle references.
You put it in there.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
I know what a witness is.
He ain't offerin me shit.
You haven't. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, so keep it shut.
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Yes, Sir.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
You must have some idea about him.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No.
Why not? You heard my voice?
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
The elevator wasn't working?
No, it has a mind of its own.
Can I see your hands?
My hands?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Me?
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
No.
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
Did Amber have a dog?
What color was it?
I don't know.
Have you been here long?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a hollow car?
Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded hollow ..
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
Of course I would ..
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
What are you reading?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Are you wearing a uniform?
No.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Are you married?
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that Hamlet?
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
Do you pray?
Pray?
You said, you were in the bad lands?
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
Have you known her long?
I was married to her sister ..
I know what you're like ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
Ross told me.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
He said that? What else did he say?
Just your age.
Which is what?
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
I have to talk to you, Helena.
I know.
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
Has he got your aunt's address?
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
No I'm not.
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
Why can't I stay with you?
It's not possible right now.
Why?
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
I'm going back to the institute.
No .. not now ..
Don't say that. Don't you dare say that .. I believe you  ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Then explain it to me. I got enough darkness, don't I?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to kill you - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to kill you - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
Why does he want to kill me?
I can't identify him ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
Then why didn't he kill me?
He doesn't need my help.
You do?
I'm blind because my father drank.
I wanna be near you ...
I think they're gonna arrest me.
It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
Not since we were kids.
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
What are you doing, Travis?
Why?
You got a warrant for this?
Who sought the warrant?
Interview over, Blattis ...
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
Yeah, I guess I do.
And you got no idea with who?
When did John divorce?
What was she like?
You think he still loves her?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
You think John would like it?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Even better.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
She married some English prick.
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Of course.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
What do you want to know, Evan?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
Hey, we're not talking talk tonight.
Whass going on here?
Alright, guys. We stop this now.
Shut up, King Jay ..
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Whatta you mean, horrible?
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Ask him.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Where... where are my clothes?
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
I dunno.  Just being weird.
So it didn't feel... weird?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
You'll see.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
Go on. Sit down.
Why are you doing all this for me?
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Like how?
I walk differently?
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
What?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
He's a fucking maniac!
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
How about it?
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Ha! Where's that?
What's happened to you?
Why's that?
Because you're... different.
Yeah?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Oh? There's proof now?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
I just thought you should know.
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
ERRR-IIIC!
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
There's one major hole in your story.
Which is?
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
Eric!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
This is how you play God.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
One way to find out.
Oh, my God.
A bird cage.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
What?
What's a bad idea?
We can't just...
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Her new boyfriend.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should accept the inevitable. You believe that?
Sorry.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
How much weight have you lost?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
You hate to swim.
People change.
You look good.
So do you.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Because Dr. Grant isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
Oh, don't worry about that.
What?
What did you say?
Nothing.
What did you say!
Just drop it Paul!
Young adult.
Eric...
That's him. ThatÃ†s Eric!
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
No, it's...
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
ItÃ†s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
Eric! Are you here?
Eric!
Udesky.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Stop! Take me back!
It's not safe.
We have to help him.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
Well what?
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, itÃ†s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
That one time was just the bumper.
When did you have it last?
I don't remember
Think.
What?...WHAT!?
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
He could have died.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
We should try fishing again.
You mean it?
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
I would completely support that.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
Who's that?
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
What about Eric?
You had the phone the whole time?
Where is it?
PAUL!
Is something the matter?
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
They couldnÃ†t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
I donÃ†t know.
I thought you were an expert.
Dr. Grant was.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
Sure.
It won't hold!
How was your trip? Profitable?
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
You rented an automated litter box.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I was?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
I don't get it.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
And...?
Then you think it might have worked out?
Absolutely not.
They're here.
What?
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
That does sound lucky.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Is it a rex?
How would you classify it?
They never got that big.
Baryonyx?
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
We could co-write a paper.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
We need to keep moving.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
I hear you've got visitors.
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
I CAN GET HIM!
NO!
Hmm?
He used to know me.
Really?  What do you do there?
Raptors, mostly.
You remember the sounds they made?
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
To a degree we never imagined.
I'd better get going.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Eric, your parents are both here.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Which one do you prefer?
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
Any weapons, radios?
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
What did you think?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
How much of this island have you explored?
Why?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Kayleigh? What happened?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
Bonitas.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
You're right.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
No we're not.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Hmmm.
What time is it?
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you canÃ†t fly low enough to see anything of interest.
That's hard to believe.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
This plane can not land!
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
I have never been on this island!
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The plus is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
Well that's good.
But you never came across just one.
Amanda!
Back out! Move!
Billy!
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
It certainly does.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
You hear something?
Any damage?
Minimal is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
You are an academic.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Resentful.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
What?
What are you talking about?
I don't believe you.
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
So what?
John . . .
I'm not going, John.
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
Are you looking for a problem?
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Not without a shot of the nest.
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
Hi, Dad.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
I don't even know this woman.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Which one?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Well, is he?
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
That Richard.
I could come with you.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
How could you possibly?
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
Been there, done that.
InGen.  What's InGen?
Where does it say that?
On the side of that one truck.
What are you guys gonna do?
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
I'm fine... I'm fine...
Come on!
What?  Why?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
Okay.
Good lad.
Where do you think you're going?!
To collect my fee.
What kind of gun is that?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
How close do you have to be?
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
You've broken its leg!
What in Christ's name is going on?!
Isn't it obvious?
What is?
What is that?
Piss.
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
Good.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
Possible.
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
What's he got in there?
Piss.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Oh, God.
What?
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
She's gutty.
She's nuts.
Oh, my God.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You're gonna help us take him.
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
Our chance to do what?
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
There' no reason for name calling.
?!
It has a broken leg!
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
What do you think they want?!
No.
No way.
Lava?
No.
What are they?
I don't know.
Where's Kelly?
She's with Sarah!
We can't stay in here!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
It'll hold!
For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
I think she's with Sarah!
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Look!  Sarah!
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
What's that?
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
Why did you come here?
So that others would know about this place?
Why should they?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, why did you go up there to die?  And he said I didn't.  I went up there to live.
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
I'm her father.
Funded by whom?
John Hammond.
Think fast, Sarah.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Are you insane?!
I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
Oh, God.
What?!
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
Ian.  It's guano.
What?
Birdshit?
So what's your story, Nick?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
I believe in him.
-- way we could safely --
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
That little black line?
Give it more morphine!
Hold it down, Nick!
I'm trying!
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One no from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
WHAT ARE YOU-
JUMP!
Where's Kelly?
Where's Ian?
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Hey, I got no choice.
We have to send someone to look for him!
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Ask her.
Can the kid walk?
You've got to be kidding.
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Evan Treborn.
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Freeze! No worm-boy. No Mr. Worm
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
It didn't feel like a dream.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Y... yes. I guess I did.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
You lying son of a bitch...
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
What happened?? Where are we?!
What's wrong with you?!
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
What the hell are you doing?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Lung cancer?
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Up there.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
You look like brothers.
What was the matter with it?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
I don't know what you could have read.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Did you?
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
Huh?
I come from a big family.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
in What sense?
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the tools of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
No -- not even success.  My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.  Not for other people, it's for me.
You work in the cemetery.
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
oh; yes; determination runs in the family.
There is one thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What made you think I'd be able to get you into the Castle?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
In a manner of speaking.
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
An empty tomb?
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
you appreciate my writing.
Yes.
Will you do me a favor then?
Another one?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
What an extraordinary request!
It's my last and final one.
Not necessarily.  A wife would.
I gave it to him yesterday.
No, I left it in his office.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
I'll commit that to memory.
Yes.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
You're just doing your job.
You're detestable.
You wanted to see me, sir.
Sit down, Kafka.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
... My ... social situation?
You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
I usually take lunch by the River.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
Well, I --
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
-- Eduard --
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
In a small way.
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
I do.
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
Was there something else?
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
The Orlac claim.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
I know.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Why would you suppose so?
One of you must be mistaken.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
Hello again.
I've never seen you here before.
Have you looked?
Yes.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
No.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
I suspected that he -- well.
What?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
What's funny?
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
How long were you and Eduard --
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the hands of the police.
What could he have done to warrant that?
Are you free tonight?
... All right.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
And you ...?
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
I'm sorry.
Ah -- we're back to the authorities you spoke of.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
What of it?
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
He was murdered.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Yes -- which is why quiet
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Why were you given notice?
They're not obliged to tell.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  He could've killed Eduard.
You don't believe that.
I wouldn't put it past him.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
He's jealous, yes, but that jealous?  He's too cautious.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I've heard of it happening.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Usually.
Oh my God oh my God...
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
Gabriela ...?
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
I -- I found your jailer.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
I told you, they're dead.  It's finished.
Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
No -- not this time.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
-- Listen to me --
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Your office is the Workmen's --
Accident And Compensation Association.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
I don't know.
Was he depressed?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
No, I suppose not.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
We know that.
What makes you think so?
... Just a perception.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one shut -- not at all.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
Shut up, Tommy!
Maybe it's true then what she said.
What did she say?
Do you?
You mean you've actually begun some?
What's the matter with you?
you should meet my father.
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
... Why take me into your confidence?
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young clerk could find himself in such a fix.
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of this group.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to yourselves!
... A piece of paper ...
... A piece of paper ...
Accident and Compensation -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
It usually is.
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
I'm overworked as it is.  Raban did you say?
Wait a minute.  Raban?  Where have I heard that name?
What's the matter?
Why would we keep files on dead employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
It's gone out so quickly?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
you mean my chief has it.
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
Orlac is an account?
All these in the last year?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
I could always apply there.
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle is one of the Directors of this firm.
You're done.  End of story.
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Did he come around often?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Uh uh.
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
-- May I? It's so --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Guess!
I do not love him.
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Why isn't he locked up?
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Oh no.
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
Yes -- all right --
-- We can talk --
Yes.
All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
Will you let me go then?
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
I said yes, I see.
Oh no, I don't think --
What is it?
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
What about?
My name's John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Who?
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Why?
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Honest?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Mm.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Mm.
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
No, I'm look --
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Could I ask some questions?
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
-- Tuscarora --
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
You remind me of my uncle.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
What about everything since?
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
Most of them.
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
How would I remember?
How else do you meet them? Pimps?
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
OK.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
What? This?
OK?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
I go on rounds.
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Well do you think it was him?
What do you think?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
He never told me.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
Is that what you gave him?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
No.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
You said you wanted these.
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Is there anything more I could --
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
Try some other ways.
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
And I don't think that was Tom.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Well --
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Yeah, you got to me.
us city folks? the sin; the glitter; the wickedness?
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Goodbye.
It's kind of late.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Not much point to this, is there?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
Thanks.
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
When?
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
-- Then you don't need me.
How?
The same as Jane McKenna.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
How can you do it to yourself?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
You got a name, cop?
Please.
We did this before.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I don't like getting splashed.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
My bed.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
Mm.
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
Yup.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Yeah.
What am I supposed to say?
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
What?
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Don't touch anything.
Oh look what he did in them.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Bree --
Right back at the start, right?
Go down in my room.
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
With Trina.
I called Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
How do you know how bad it was?
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Trask wants to talk with you.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
Mm.
You're going back?
Mm.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.
You wanted to, or you are?
I am.
You could at least look at me!
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
About what?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
I don't think so.
They don't scare me any more.
What?
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
OK.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Can you use these?
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
No. I'm sore.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
I believed her, Pete.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Then, close the case.
I better keep looking.
Where, how?
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
It's got to make sense some way.
I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
Well as a matter of --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Some mistake perhaps that --
You must be discouraged.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
That who?
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
Someone's been doing all these things.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
I can't follow you.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
Well --
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
It's not so bad.
I wanted to give it to you first.
Goodbye, Pete.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
She told me.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Did she talk about him to you?
Has she talked with you since prison?
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
I know Tom Grunemann.
We grew up together. Kids.
No.
No.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
No.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
I looked it up.
Yeah.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
I don't believe Tom's alive.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, I noticed...
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
He just appeared.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Yeah?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Oh, but you have, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
Go ahead.
It happens when I land.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
He's not gonna hurt me.
--Who is he?
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
Mr. Cyr!
C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
And what would he do come winter?
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
Around here.  Yeah.
We'd only just met.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Keystone what?
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
Cocktail?
No!!  What's with digging the holes?
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
Everybody out, back to your tents, now!
Could she stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
No!!  Out!
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
And you like me.
I do not like you.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of you and it's liberating to say so.
What are you doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
This could end up saving your life,--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it is a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they do charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
That Walt guy got hit underwater--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
What I'm saying is if it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
Yup.
His head was just... bitten off.
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
This is a setback.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Bite my bishop.
What's that?
It came from across the lake.
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
That sounds good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
Raincheck.
Then do it!!
You probably do want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
So profound and fat.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he is a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. A grand dragon.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
No!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
Where is he?!
I don't know!
At school they'd always say go first.
He never said go.
This time, I'm gonna kick your ass.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Forget it.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
We both know what they'll do.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
That's actually the easy part.
The more he thrashes, the better.
You ready on shore?
We're ready.
I got something on the screen.
Where?  Where?
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  Everybody up on the trucks.
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling go which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
No.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
You talk to Bickerman?
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
Just those two.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since he's the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
That hurt my feelings.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
Hector.
Such the flirt.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
I'm just saying last resort.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
What?  Oh as if I'm interested.
As if.  Will you miss me?
Are you sure?
Scales were oval.  It was an Asian crocodile.
Jack!
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
Did you want to be killed by it?
Nothing's real.
Excuse me?
Nothing's real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
With crocodiles... everything's even.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Oh, bullshit.
Didn't even sound good?
No.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
What?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
They could try to tranq him on land.
They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
And how would we neutralize him?
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
I'm okay.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
You're gonna be okay.
Guess I finally got bit.
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
He's gonna live?
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Kelly Scott.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Yes, it did seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it worked, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a small point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by him, but you seemed quick to join in.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
Hank says he's sure.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Never been to Maine before?
I told you.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
And even if they did, I doubt he or she would have problems with tents.
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
Well.  You don't have to stay out here, why don't--
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
Oh my God.
What?
If this is who I think it is.  It is.
In Maine?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Something's in that water.
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
Baby crocs?
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
What are you doing?
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
I beg your pardon?
Whatever's out there did flip over a canoe--
I am not staying on shore.
It's too dangerous for--
You flew up here because your boss--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
I'm sorry but you're...
Okay.  We're up at six.
Good.
'Night.
He thinks they're what?
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
Good.  See ya soon.
Good luck.
You okay?  Kelly?
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
That's probably good.
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
Are you okay?
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Nice?  Nice would be you look pretty
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Just forget it.
Why he's that big, I don't know. Why he's here... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
Like little children.  You okay?
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Sorry.
It's okay.
Ow.  Shit.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
No thanks.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Thank you.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
Maybe.  I've always read about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace while something is actually... y'know... happening.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Ssssh!
I heard something.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
You're mushing it a little around the--
I'm not mushing it.
That is it!!
No.  I keep getting hit with heads!
You calm down!
What?
Look.
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
No!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
Okay.
We might as well pack.
Good idea.
Are we crazy?
Well...
It can't work.
He has been going after everything. It could work.  But this is not a happy cow.
He looks like a giant tea bag.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He's floating.  Take it home.
You wouldn't?
Watch out!!
We gotta get to Hector!!
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
He heeds a tourniquet.
You wanna ride in my truck?
You sure?  I don't mind...
No, I actually want to stay for a little while.
Yeah.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
It was... something meeting you.
Likewise.
Different worlds, Jack.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Probably not.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
Good thinking.
We set?
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
I'm ready when you are.
Let's go.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
I'll call the coroner.
What's that?
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't look like it.
They look like they're jumping.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
You said nobody came in here!
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
So does he.
You gotta be kidding.
Other than to eat us?
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
Where is he?!
If you get a safe shot...
I'll take it!
He's done.  He's dying.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
Thanks for your help.
You too.
He just came up screaming.
Did he say anything?
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
And you didn't see anything?
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
Yes.
Is the dead guy in there?
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
I wouldn't.
Well.  At wakes.
This is a little different.
I can look at dead things.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Seconds.  Three, four.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Yes.
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
Not yet.
What kind of backup do we have?
What?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
You have a thing against museums?
Ever even been in one?
What is that?
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
Was he swallowed?
Sheriff.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
Gee.
We're staying in tents?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Yes, camp, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard tents, will there be toilets?
What the hell?
What?
I thought I saw...
Hey!!
You threw it at me!!
I just let go of it.
With what?
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's here... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
They don't believe her.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker.
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Apologize?
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
I'm sorry.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
You like Jack?
Hector thinks you like him.
You think Jack's handsome?
What is this?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
What was that?
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Yes.
Are you okay?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
Hank!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Look.
What is she doing now?  Mother of God.
What?
Look ten feet into the water.
If he gets close, you go up, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
They're coming right in.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
That it's about to go wrong.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Should I?
Wait.
I guess.
Kevin, hey.
Absolutely.
I had a great time last night. Again.
Me too.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, us...
I was working for you when us started, what's--
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
The somebody else part?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Else.
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, you... you're y'know...
A jerk.
It's ten after nine.
Yes, well...  famished.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
I want you to go there.
Sorry?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Are you on drugs?
Kelly--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Part of our research--
I'm not even a field person.
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
It has nothing to do with--
Kelly--
I am not going to Maine.  That's ridiculous.
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Well you shouldn't have.  How did you even know where I was.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
You?
You?
You and Kevin.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
No.
Myra.
Never cock. Just squeeze.
What'd I do?
Thanks, Ardelia.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Boy, is that smart...
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
No. He won't come after me.
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
He's here, Ardelia.
Desperately random. What does he mean?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
But why? He didn't weight the others.
every day.
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Where?
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Sometimes.
I will... I promise.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
I understand.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
Sir, doesn't this William Rubin strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Good idea.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
That wasn't me.
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
I think we may be, yes.
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Yes sir.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. Mofet... Any followup on her?
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But Split City sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Miggs has been murdered.
Murdered...? How?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Why?
Why not?
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
Like I have a knack for Dr. Lecter?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
Are you finished?
What do you see, Starling?
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
Point taken.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
You seem pretty sure of that.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
But if he knew we have so little time -
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
Let's get some coffee and talk.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
You do until six p.m.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
Starling -
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Where?
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is Jamie Gumb
Sewing...
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was John Grant. Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Not lately. But maybe someday.
Dr. Lecter...
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
Did you ever work with her?
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
I think so.
Sometimes you do.
I am, yes.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
He said - I can smell your cunt.
Yes.
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Five... so far.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
No. You ate yours.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
Reasonably so. Yes.
And the questionnaire...?
Then please - do this test for me.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Why don't you tell me about Miss Mofet? You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
I never thought about it.
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
I don't know. Is it?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Who killed your patient?
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
By the book, he's a sadist.
Yes.
They all were.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
A moth... How did you predict that?
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Go, Doctor.
The death of my father.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Horses - and sheep...
Two months.
I - ran away...
No.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
On what basis would they reject him?
Yes, Doctor. Please.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this William Rubin, even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
Then tell me how.
He kills w-
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
No. We just -
All right, then tell me how -
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
Later, listen, I'll -
And - one morning I just - ran away...
Early. Still dark.
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
Yes...! They were screaming.
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Yes...
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Lecter -
You know I can't make that promise.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
Be my guest.
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
What's wrong?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
I'm not a doctor.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
And?
Why Sixpack?
They found this?
Was there such a thing?
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Stay calm!
Doc eat already?
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
It's got Hazy!
What has?
One of those chunks of Sixpack!  Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
Were, Doss were.
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
He did.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Crunch...Implosion.
Jesus Christ...
No way...
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
No.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Go on!
No!
That's an order!
Fuck your orders!
Your suit, Becky!
How do you know it was Williams?
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
You did good...
What?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Still...you did the right thing.
I need more light on that, Four.
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
You screw around like that again and--
Why can't we pick up his signal?
How's astronaut training?
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Good...It's going good.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
Well, I always heard you don't learn leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
What can we do?
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
Shit!  He sent them all.
The escape bubbles?
They know, don't they?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
What are you doing?
Seeing how my stock's doing...
We're on backup air.
How much time does that give us?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Can't we fix it?
Where's Jones?
It hit me!  Where are they?!
I can't see them!
He's not at his station.
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
Something wrong, Cobb?
What's wrong with it?
All right...
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Shut up, all of you.
No!
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Charge set?
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
I know that.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Do it.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Forty-eight hours!
Made your million, yet?
How's TransOcean doing?
I signed-up for the stock option.
Timex...
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Yes sir...
So that's all you do?...
Routine, my ass!  Ain't nothin' routine about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
That thing happens to be my friend.
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Twelve hours!
How'd you do that?
Under there?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
Like a leech.
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
Clear for pickup.
Let's hope it holds.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
Debbie Does Dallas...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about whys
Sixpack...
How is he?
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
What on earth's the matter with you?
I ought to smack your face!
What's wrong?
DeJesus...It's got him.
It needs blood?
Oh man, that's just great...
What is it?
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
What is it?
The air's stopped.
The shack...
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Don't spend all day down there.
Yeah.
Are you sure you saw something?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
It saw us!
I'm not touching you!
Your pocket?
Right.
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Hardly.
I'll kill him!
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Well, it's still a good idea.
Seven hundred for the pair.
A what?
Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
It's hit us all hard!
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
I still will, if you don't mind.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
Yes?
Bacon, see what we got.
That inspires confidence, that does.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
And Tom took care of them.
Invitations?
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Hit the fuckers.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
And look what happened to that.
That's it all done, we are off.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
I hope this is the right move.
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
You what? What are you on about?
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
Well, what's going on?
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
There's nothing in it!
I mean it's fucking empty.
Who's this fat man, then?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
What do you mean?
He means they're thieving dogs.
What the hell are you doing here?
Why, what's up?
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
Right as rain.
Well, what did he say?
You and me, Tom.
What do you mean, me?
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Tom, this is our case.
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
I'11 meet you in the car.
Tom?
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
A hundred grand.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
You will what?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That's if I want to see you.
I'll see ya.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
You know how much it is, Nick.
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
Get your fingers out of my soup!
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
That's going on optimism.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
Tom, you're all heart.
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!
Where did you get those from, a museum?
Nick the Greek.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
What's left over?'
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
What about all the gear?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
You would take a pain Ã�n the arse full stop.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Six.
Twelve.
How many feet?
Er, well, twelve.
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
How the fuck should I know?
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
How much?
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
Hello, L.A.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
They go together.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Who?
Nix?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
Who is he?
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
It'll be something hokey.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
You heard right.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
Why?
My life was too weird for her.
I love weird.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
Nope.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
That's Butterfield...
A Nix specialty?
Maybe they're not tricks.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Knew what?
Hokey enough for you?
Thanks, Billy.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Right.
Right.
You did.  Didn't you?
Beats me.
Deep shit?
I told you --
All right.  It was...
Please.
I'll tell you.
Not yet.
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Why did you wait so long?
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
What is he?
Did your husband know Quaid?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
You don't?
I think we make our own futures.
What's the connection?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
Why not?
He's a secretive man.
And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
Sorry.  You asked.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
Where do I sign?
Harry.
I'm no bodyguard.
When do you want me to start?
Do you?
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
Sure.
He's good.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Are they treating you okay?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
I don't know where you'd start.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
They won't tell you anything.
I can be very persuasive.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
How did it go today?
They were jealous of him.
Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
You didn't marry him for love.
So why did you marry him?
That's my business. Harry.
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Yes.  You do that.
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
What did you find?
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Oh Christ.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
He was the real thing, right?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
Stuff?
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
He taught all this to Swann?
Some or it.
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
I told you --
No.
You said you weren't with him for love.
I wasn't.
What then?
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
It's okay.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I'm here, aren't I?
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Nothing you don't want.
I was so afraid.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
And they all came...
Quaid and Jennifer--
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
What was that?
It's okay.
Are you all right?
Harry?
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Oh God!
Hang on!
I've got to help him.
You can't.
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
No!  No!  No!
Harry...
... oh... God...
I'm here, Harry.
...yes?
Yes.
I... have... to.
Harry?
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
Is it finished?
I think so.
What the fuck?
Valentin?
Good.  There.  Yes?
You saw this?
No word from D'Amour?
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
I left three messages already.
What about me?
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Bad show last night?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
... they believe you.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
I just saw him.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
No.  I'm not going near him.
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
vanished.
Are you finished with me?
No.  Not yet...
You believe that?
Heaven and Hell?
So could you walk on water?
What about Swann's miracles?
I heard he was the best.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
I'd like to hear them.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
With what?
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Shit.
Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.
What are you, my mother?
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
We've never met.
Then what do you want?
I'm here to offer you a job.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Whose is the car?
Mine.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Maybe I just bought it.
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you a gambling man?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
What's the difference?
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Are you a believer, then?
Swann's wife.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Why'd you come here?
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
What for?
A ticket home,
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
I like to know why things happen.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
No.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
I'm afraid she's not in.
When will she be in?
I can't let you in.
Yeah, I know.
You want more money, is that it?
Leave her alone --
Shut up!
Are you satisfied now?
No.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
I tried to pay you off.
Was that Swann's idea?
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
I want to see Swann face to face.
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
D'Amour --
Shit...
Help me.
Him too.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Don't bother.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
What about?
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
A Mister Quaid?
I won't say anything.
Does anybody?
And what does Jennifer think's real?
What?
Yeah.  You could say that.
Not much.
Hold on.
The Puritan?
Who is he?
That.
Harry D'Amour.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
Not the Walter Wilder?
Sure.  Vivovich.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
For what?
I only wear ties for funerals.
Have you been in?
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
Look, Ma, no wires.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Or murdered, like Nix.
He deserved it.
I did it for Dorothea.
Oh yeah?
So Nix won't come looking for her?
It's me betrayed him.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
I don't know what else to do.
Oh Jeez.
Will that do?  No?
You think I'm an asshole.
Didn't know you read minds.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
Is that all?
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
And you're not?
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
And he didn't have them?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Is that all?
And you believed him?
Did she know where Nix was buried?
No.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Yes.
Jesus!
They got here before us.
Looks that way.
He's better off this way.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
That's where we're all going.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
This is where we killed him.
You didn't try hard enough.
I can't... I can't go any further...
He did something with the ground.
Yes?
Can you do it?
I don't know.
Try.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
I got to go.  I'm late.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
What?
No.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Why's that?
What is?
Swann?
Is he the Puritan?
And he's dead?
No!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Binding you.
And?
Why would I want to?
Not true.
Yes.
No!
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
I missed you.
Do you think they have a room here?
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
You never said anything to me...
It's probably trivial.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
Bad?
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Sushi.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Hmmm.
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Peter, where are you?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the stop button?
What?  That's horrible!
What happened?
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
When did they find her?
I'm still shaking.
I can't believe Will killed him.
Thank God he did.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
Yeah, like...
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
I believe in you.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
Claire...
This is the person...you were talking about?
What're these?
I don't know.  What are they?
Must be a spare set.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
I found the pentacle.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
We're still going to be together.
What a...jerk!
Peter, are you okay?
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
Yes.  It's exactly...
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
What time did you make it for?
Eight.  That okay?
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
No, I wasn't, actually.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
You heard voices, you know you did.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
He will.  He has great faith.
I hope so.
You'll do it?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
What is it?
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
You fucking bastard.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
You raised me, like a son.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
You killed my parents.
Why are you doing this to me?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
What do you mean don't worry?
So...we won?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
Father, please don't die.
Well I know he's come here before.
I didn't know what else to do...
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Oh my God!
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
May I help you?
Peter Kelson?
Yes... and you are?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And also that...
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital E.
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
What's that got to do with you?
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
I do.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
I'll bet.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
So...what did you think of the tape.
What do you mean?
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
So what'd I miss?
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
I had to.
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
We need to talk.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
Please, the children.
Why did he try to kill me?
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
And the point is?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
What?!?!
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Trick him.
You should think about getting professional help.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
I don't understand what's going on.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Yes.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Then why are you here?
What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  The time of transformation is near...
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
What are you looking for exactly?
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
We needed to know all we could.
Nothing yet.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Get up!!
When's your birthday?
What?
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
There's nothing else here.
What's the bible for?
Are you alright?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
What do you mean?
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
We're going to do this.
That's true.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
No oxygen to the brain.
Maybe that's my problem.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
What about after?
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
Plenty of time.
What are these?
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
Sure.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
What did he say to you in French?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, together
Terrific.
He was trying to tell me something.
And his message was  Together
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire.
And what's that mean?
Not a lot.
Oh, Peter.
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
I know who he is.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
You know what?  You can go.
Get out of here.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
We millionaires yet?
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital E.  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Of course.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
What's this?
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
He could see me.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Thanks for handling this.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Thanks again for everything.
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
What's up?
How're you doin' today?
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Parents died?
Yeah, murder-suicide.
What happened?
She told me she killed them.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Where is she now?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn trim hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Now, where we goin', convict?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
I don't give out the details.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night.
You have a good time?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
That was Peterson upstairs.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
That's when it happened?
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
Not the Bible?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
I have to.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
How much do you know?
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Somebody hurt him?
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
No.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
You look all right now.
I am all right.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
As long as they're dead...
These are all dead, Will.
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Get him to Atlanta.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
I know...
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
What's one way?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
No other possibilities?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Why?
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
See? You do know something about him.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
For Christ's sake, why?
Is it weird?
The mark? Yes.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
Who did he ask for?
You.
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
What is it?
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Personal ads?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Run it.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Who is it?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
What'd it say?
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
Tell me now.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Get me a plane...
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
I won't be here.
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
You got the message Lecktor called...
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
What's it narrow down to?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
That's narrow?
When are you coming back?
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
'Changes?'
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
There has to be.
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
He's a very shy boy...
What?
Something Lecktor said.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
It's not over yet.
Will?
What's that?
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
It's getting late and...
It's the guard in the storeroom.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
See if there's another label underneath.
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
Parking permits...
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
This is our boy...!
Will...?
What?
You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
How far away's the back-up?
Three minutes.
I'll cover the back.
Stay in the trees.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
Where the hell's Graham!
Let's get to the physical.
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
In eight days.
Let me stick this in the black hole.
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
It'll do fine.
I'll take you.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Tonic will be fine.
In the kitchen.
How did you come to Gateway?
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
You worked out well.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Uh-huh.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
That was nice of you to think of that.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
Is that you. D?
I'm fine.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
I have work to do at the plant.
I'll get my purse.
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
I'm fine, Francis.
Francis? Where are you?
No. Reba...?
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
It's me.
Who?
Me.
Francis...?
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
The Tooth...
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
No.
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
I don't want to know.
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Yes.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
I don't know...
In a little while I'll help you understand.
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
No. I don't want to see you.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Do you see?
Yes.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Yes.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
God, no.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
No.
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
You'll let me go now?
You will tell the truth?
Absolutely,
Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
I want to see Lecktor now.
It's Will Graham...
Where did you get it?!
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Thank you very much.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
I don't understand.
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He's misunderstood.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
I don't want to do that,
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
'Intimate? !"
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
He only bit women so far, right?
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
What's average?
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
What would you call him?
To yourself...
I call him a monster.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What about the dog?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
What did he want?
He asked how you are.
And you said?
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
We have it good, don't we?
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
What the hell can I do?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
If I were?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
Molly?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
Hello, hotshot!
At the store. You doin' some good?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Tell me about yourself.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue, then.
Blue is cold.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
I love you...
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
I remember.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
No.
Then why?
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Can you quit?
No.
And... where are things?
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
What will you do?
Is Crawford going with you?
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
Will...
Hello.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
I want to see you, too.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Come home with me.
What's this Mama shit?
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
What's the problem, Molly?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Will?  You could come up here.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
That's not true.
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
You got a deal...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Yes. Is Molly there?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
Tell her I called.
That's right.
Thanks.
Go on to the house.
My name's Will Graham. I...
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
Will it keep them out?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Yes.
I figured I'd ask you...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
We don't know that.
Are you gonna kill him?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
How did it happen?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
How?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
You went in the apartment?
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
Did the girl die?
No.
She got all right?
...after a while.
And Hobbs died?
...yes.
What kind of coffee do you like?
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
Stuart is fine.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
No.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
You read about it, I'm sure.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you would have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
You're very tan, Will.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Do you have the file with you
Yes.
Pictures?
Do you dream much, Will?
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
What were the yards like?
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
Yes. I'd considered it.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
May I keep the file?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
What do you want?
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
I don't believe in God.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Why does it feel good?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Yes.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Let's walk the route.
Well?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
That's never been one of my problems.
What are you talkin' about?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
The bet's off.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
You made that move, huh?
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
I think I know her.
From what?
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
Hiya.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
I'm sorry... um... ?
Burt.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
You don't know?
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
That's the thing. I have this condition.
Condition?
I have no memory.
Amnesia?
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
How long have I been here?
Couple days.
So you're holding my calls?
As requested.
What makes you think he's my friend?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
Hi, Leonard.
Shit. Wrong room.
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
Then why is this my handwriting?
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
When was I in here?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Leonard.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
Yeah?
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
That's right I did, didn't I?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Thanks.
Interested in buying one?
I forget.
Jimmy?
Do you remember me?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Don't say anything else.
I don't want blood on them.
Strip!
You think you can bargain with me?!
I don't want your fucking money!
You don't remember me.
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
You did explain, Lenny.
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
You told me.
Yeah.
So you have information for me?
Is that what your little note says?
Yes.
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Have I told you what this man did?				*
Yes.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Tell me about her again.
Why?
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
It's isolated.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Sorry.
They treating you alright?
Don't remember.
You know what we have in common?
Sleep okay?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
How do I know he did that to you?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
So I just take your word?
Yes.
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
Did you?
What?
Kill him.
Course not.
There are things you know for sure.
Such as?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Your wife?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
It's not easy to be calm when -
Just relax.
What happened?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
Who did he go to meet?
What do the police think?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Kill him.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
Who?
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
And what did he say?
Where is he?
What are you gonna do?
I'll go see him.
And?
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah?
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
I told him about your car.
Why would you do that?
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
What's wrong?
Somebody's come. Already.
Calls himself Dodd.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Did you?
No!
What's this all about?
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
I have this condition -
What happened?
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
Neither do I.
Help me.
How?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
What?
Kill him. I'll pay you.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
That's different.
Don't talk about my wife.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Calm down.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Yes.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Shut the fuck up!
Don't say another fucking word!
About your whore of a wife?
Can I ask you something?
They're not looking for him.
Why not?
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
On the house.
Thanks.
My wife.
Sweet.
Dying.
What?
I remember my wife dying.
Beer, please.
What do you want?
A BEER, please.
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
There's a dress code?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Well, that's me.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
You tell me.
I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
You're the memory guy?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
My name's Leonard.							 *
Did Teddy send you?
I don't know.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
So why did you come here?
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is faking anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
Teddy!
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Shut your mouth!
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
I guess I've told you about my condition.
This is your car.
You're in a playful mood.
What the hell you want to go there for?
You know it?
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
I don't remember.
Yup?
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
John Gammell?
I'll be waiting.							   *
You said you were leaving town.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
Who?
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Why?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Why?
You really want to find this guy?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
You're living.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Probably left it in your room.
Why are you here?
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
You don't know him?
No! Should I?
I don't think so.
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Natalie? Natalie who?
Why?
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
I don't know.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
Fucking hope not.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Shut it, Teddy.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Give me your keys.
So was he scared?
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
What's wrong with this one?
You like it? Let's trade.
So what are you gonna do now?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Natalie who?
Who the fuck are you?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Prove it.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Unfinished business.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
There.
Must be billy's girl.
Come on.
What do you mean bad news?
She's involved with these drug dealers.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
From who?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
She couldn't.
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
She has no idea who I am.
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
Happy now?
Why?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
What sort of questions?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
Like what?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
I didn't sell -
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town.
How'd you know I was in here?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
Why?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.

What's wrong?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?

Yeah.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
We know these people...!
And what?
Oh, yeah...
With Sonny.  110%.
They'll kill Gina.
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
JosÃš Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
It's a rip and a hit.
You can't.
Just came in.  She's still alive.
We're not certain!
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
They knew about Alonzo, before he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
You need to consider a few issues.
Sure.
I got to talk to my ADO...
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
I thought we had to meet the Man.
You do.
When?
Right now.
We want it back.
Okay.
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
What's nothing?
Nothing.  As in free
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
And what is that?
What do you like to drink?
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
How fast does that go?
It goes very fast.
Show me...?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the only place for mojitas...
The Keys?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
Were you born in Havana?
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
She's dead...
Your father?
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
How's he not your husband?
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Later!  Do you dance?
I dance...
Tell me everything.
No.
I insist.
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Died in childbirth, having me...
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
Probable...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
That's right.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Exactly.
Like...?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Cost less.  That's the point.
Is it December?
What do you mean?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  And why
Good samba dancing...?
Zero risk.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Available cash is not an issue for us...
Twenty-eight-point-five.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Maybe I'm only one.
Hola, chica.
Hola, viejo.
I forgot the napkins.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
They're all the same.  Financial security is around the corner. Your friends love you.
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, Live now because life is dust.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
Why?
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Really?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
When?
Of course.
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
Is this the protective male talk?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
...in the morning.
Yero, by himself?
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
If they attack you...
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They will wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
No.
No part of it wasn't real.
I know.  And now?
It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
What...?
I am not John Wayne.  There is no S on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
Red light, green light, JosÃš?
Extras tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of Things Aquatic?
He tried to...do business...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?

Yeah?
What friend?

What is it?
Alonzo...
Stevens?
Something's wrong.
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
Track with me, here...  They knew the Russians were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
It says, We do not fear you.  It says, Fuck off and die.  It says, We get down for recreation...
So?
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us before Nicholas calls.
People gonna walk into this place and say, Ola
No, viejo.  That was JosÃš Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall.
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
What kind of weight?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
What you get from us is a date.  A place.  In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami.  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
Then it don't work.
Anything?
Nothing.
Where we meeting 'em...?
What do we got?
Five minutes...
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
Who knows...
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
No.
Good.  So let's go...
How much we looking for?
Nothing.
Where the hell are you, man?
On my way back...
Where'd you go?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
Where?
Verdado.
Verdado where?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
No.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
We're makin' moves on each other.
Oh, that makes it okay, then.
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
Their loads are poly-drug.  E from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan H. Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
Hey, fuck him.
Chill out Sonny.
We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in The Miami Herald to impress the slug farm in DC...
What is going on...?!
As in...?
There is undercover.  And there is Which way is up?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
I am asking.  You to me.
Do you believe...I have forgotten I am a cop?
I would never doubt you.
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
And JosÃš, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
What's the point?  It's going down.
Call the US Coast Guard:  Come and arrest our ass.  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
Go ahead.
Switek?
Then you should.
Hello?
This is Agent James Fujima.
Detective Crockett.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Okay.  What's up?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  You know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word foreboding? As in badness is happening to your deal right fucking now?
Buy and walk?  Buy and bust? Reverse undercover?  What?
Meet and greet.  I flash you some of mine
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
...so there's no industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
We don't know.
So what do you want?
To recruit you.
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Never heard of him.
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Who said, go exploring?  We want this staying on track.
Who's the we?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  Low-level producer.  Yeah, right...
What are you talking about?
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
Control your men.
Have faith.
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
How will it stand up?
Yeah...?
Yeah.
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
I don't understand...
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
Where are you?
Alonzo...!
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
White supremacist types.
C'mon, man!
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
Who are you talking to?
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
So?
He did volunteer one time...
You okay?
You sure?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Okay...see you soon.
What flowers?
What's it say?
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
I think JosÃš suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
Define small.
And as an investment in the future...
Future of...?
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
That sonofabitch!
You set this up!
Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
So lay it out, my brother...
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Do we need this...?
Then what were we talking to you for?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
This the load you lost a while back?
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
Alonzo...
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
They lied.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Getchmis...?
Looks like a cheap hotel.
The kids? Why are they...
Two kilos.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Twenty months?
Years?
Tunnel?
We go through the wall?
KNOCK IT OFF!
It's there!
How's your hernia?
Anybody bitten?
They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
Who?
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Shit.
Everything.
Dad...I'm...
Yeah. How's Mom?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Where you staying, Dad?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
For the money... )
I know.
DAD!
Sure.
About ten kilometers.
Sixty?
Those mountains? are they?
Not far. Just a little way.
I'll pay extra
Where are the minefields?
No, I'm not afraid.
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Yes.  I think so.
Stupid.
But didn't have heroin.
But just...
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
...She was on the plane.
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
About as good as it looks.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
What they give you?
It's not fair!
That doesn't seem so bad.
He wasn't even in the car?
How long?
Hello.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
And?
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
What do you mean?
Get the... midnight... express.
What's that?
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Section 13?
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Where is it?
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
You got your stuff?
Yeah.
Okay?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
What?  You gotta be joking.
We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace.  Now let's go.  Doubletime!
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
Yeah.
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
What?
After we're outside the kogus?
Oh we... we...
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
Whose?
I want to cut his throat.
It's already been cut.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
You know where it is?
What?
I know where it is.
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Hishradyo.
His radio Back of his open, radio...
Just got some news on Bell.
What?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Oh shit.
Why the suit?
Maybe he's changing jobs.
I think I've been poisoned.
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
Never was anybody like you...
You're right.
My passport!
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
You're ayip!
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
That's a great philosophy.
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Mr. Yesil.
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
What'd the Prosecutor say?
Did you ask for bail?
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
What lawyer?
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
Oh, my!
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
What do you want to know?
Anything you can tell me might help.
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Thank you.
Sure.
It's right this way.
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
I'm not much of a critic.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
Sure.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
You got a point there...
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
my number One fan.
Here.
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
Will I be able to walk?
Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Following me?
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe...
You want to read it?
If you wouldn't mind.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
What's your new book called?
I don't have a title yet.
What's it about?
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but Misery for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Oh, like I could do that?
But what?
Nothing.
No, what is it?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
I can take it, go ahead.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
Pretty rough so far.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
The profanity bothers you?
It has no nobility.
Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
It's fine.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
Then the roads are open...
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
The phones are working?
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
My daughter must be going nuts.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would great be insulting?
I can live with great.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
Thank you so much.
My pleasure.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
I'm getting to believe you.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
The Sistine Chapel?
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
I know how that can be.
I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
I'm...
Done?
No problem.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
Well, I hope you like it.
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
I DIDN'T...
Then who did?
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
Perfect.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way.
Show me the way?
Yes.
You want me to burn my book?
Yes.
You want me to burn my book?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
Then light the match, Paul.
No big deal.
So you've indicated. Do it.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
I don't know.
Great.
See, isn't this nice?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
Set what up?
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an n. I told the saleslady n was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
C'mere, I'll show you.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
No, just the paper will be fine.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Annie, what's the matter?
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? You bought the wrong paper
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
I want my pills NOW!
It'll only take a second.
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
What? What happened to I'll treasure whatever you do?
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
not fair?
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
--cliff-hangers--
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--
HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any experimental blood transfusion that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
I can't write this anymore.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
The gotta. Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the gotta.
I said that?
You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, I 'gotta' know will she live
What about a bee...?
Nothing.
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Yeah, yeah...
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the ns.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
...have to wait.
Not even a hint?
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
I hope you like it.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Oh...
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
A toast?
Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Well, it certainly says you.
You really think so?
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
To Misery.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
I think you're right.
Annie, what is it?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
Why would you lose me?
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
It is.
Paul, I know you've been out.
No, I haven't.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Don't talk to me like that.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Be my guest.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Maybe.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
I'm glad you like it.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
It will.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
You don't know?
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Yes, Paul.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Ahh!!!
Did I do good?
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Half a million.
Jesus.
Stop--stop right here.
Could be the weight of the snow.
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
Just from his agent.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
What?
They're hauling Misery into court.
That's nice.
Just leave it, all right?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
What thing?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
There's that spice again.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
Yes.
People sure like those Misery books.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
You think he might be missing?
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
Maybe you can, Libby.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
So do I...
I'm sure you're right.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Newspapers?
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
You're still a writer.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Marcia, please.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Marcia, you know I started Misery on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, Ooh
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
Did they win?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
That'd be a first.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
Great.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
I thought you were over it.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
right  don't go too far ahead of me now -
From her point of view or mine?
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
Hugh, I'm impressed..
Not much luggage.
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
How grateful?
Well that depends.
On what.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
How do you that.
Ahh..
Mmmm.
And my room?
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
Oh, I am.  Later..
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
You won.
I suppose I did.
What made you pick that nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
'Thief in the Night?'
Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?
See anything you like?
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
To win?
What else?
You picked another winner!
Well, that's good, isn't?
To do what?
Sort it all out.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Lovely.
Feel like pleading for your life?
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
What are you talking about?
In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
An outbreak of Chimera.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
Nyah!
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
Fight a bit of a cold..
And you're happy about that?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
I knew where it was.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
What was the top bid?
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
In any case we don't want your cash.
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
..or hard wired..
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself.  So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.
It is, Billy.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
I'm not ready!
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
..in the building...
Not for seven more minutes.
Range is two kay.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
And the check's in the mall.
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
I am. She is.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Do you know me?
No.  Should I?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh?
What are you doing here?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Oh, either way works for me.
right..where is it?
Far right.
Where's the bloody -
this is very disconerting..
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
I wouldn't do that.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
Indeed.
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
You didn't do that badly.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Hola..
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
Listen to what?
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
What's you name?
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
Awfully short notice..
Care to wait a decent interval?
Who wants to be decent?..
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for this?
They've got a book for everything.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Which is?
That they're lying.
So where did I got right?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
So do I.  Sort of.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Of what?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
Damn, you're beautiful.
That's because I'm on my back.
What's the population of Seville any idea?
Five, six-hundred thousand.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
And six billion in the world.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Sean Ambrose, for one.
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
I'd like a little more conviction..
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
Something like that.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
And that's the only reason?
Can you think of a better one?
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
You don't trust me.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Yes?
Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
How's it going?  Everything okay?
Just like old times.
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
Have you met them?
I've no doubt.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
his left jacket pocket.
Affirmative.
Where do I meet you?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Just tell me about the money.
He's after your money.
I managed.
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
I want you out of there.
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
Ethan, tell me -
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Oh Ethan!..
It's going to be okay.
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
What did you think you were doing!
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
- you who don't have a conscience.
No.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
No.
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
No.  Should I?
No...
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Like what?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
You gotta be kidding.
An idea, yeah.
Like?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
You were there.
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
Twice.
What did you think of him?
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Not necessarily.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
right.  in fact Since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of Cash in terrorists accounts.
'Terrorists?'
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
is Where Miss hall comes in.
Excuse me?
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
And then what?
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Very.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Yes, I believe that's right.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
She sacrificed herself..
Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
Something else?
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
Yes, I gathered as much.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Yes.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
I don't.  No exactly.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
..not in time to save him.
..I'm fine..and you?
It's the transponder.
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
That simple, huh?
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Left jacket pocket?
Roger that.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
She must still be on the property.
I told her to get outta there.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Nyah still on the property?
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Now how to get in there.
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
Luther, say again.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
Good job.  And thanks.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  We taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  EverybodyÃ�s got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
S.O.P..
Think, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt want?!
Okay!
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
And if we donÃ�t find him - weÃ�ll search the whole train again.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
HeÃ�s putting on a show, Barnes.
I donÃ�t know.  It didnÃ�t say on the tickets.
This is bullshit - we donÃ�t even know what Max looks like.
You knew about Jim?
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  ThisÃ�ll have to be quicker than IÃ�d like. Certainly quicker than youÃ�d like.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youÃ�ve asked the question and you are the answer.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Satisfied?
All ten million.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
DonÃ�t Jim.
Now we donÃ�t have to eliminate him?  You like that, donÃ�t you Claire?  DonÃ�t you?
Yes.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Krieger.
Did we get it?
We got it.  On your feet.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
I'm walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Sleeping's better.
Are you all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Oh yeah?
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
Roger that.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Don't move.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
What?
Where were you?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Who is they?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who is they, who is they?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
The message is for Job.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
You're sure about this?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
What kind of help?
May I come in?
Sure...
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
You don't think we're going to make it.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
We did what we had to do.
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Kittridge...
Bastard!
What are you going to do?
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
What happened?
Okay...
Is this the only way?
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Two cars.  Where are you?
EthanÃ�s right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Of course - IÃ�m sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Ethan?
Claire...Hey...
This stuff is so sticky.
Claire.
This is Kittridge.
Go secure.
Go ahead.
WhoÃ�s dead?
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donÃ�t know
Are you damaged?
They knew we were coming.  GolitsynÃ�s dead too.  The disk is gone.
Are you intact?
Do you read me?  The list is in the open!
I donÃ�t think so.
Yes.
YouÃ�re in Prague?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  DonÃ�t disappoint me.
No sir.
Yeah.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
Yeah.  I follow you.
You mean I've lost enough agents for one night.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Who else is left?
Yes.  I see your point.
Why was there another team?
What?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
I don't quite follow you.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. Why?
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as Max.
The arms dealer.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as Job 314.  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  Golitsyn was a lightning rod, one of ours.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Kittridge.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
Certainly Ethan.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
Krieger did have the NOC list.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
I'll get you close.
Not likely, convict.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
About what?
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They still can't figure out how we did it.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and then, maybe, talk about it.
Why don't you come back with me?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
The penny drops.  You are not Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
That depends.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It's quite out of the question.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Like Job?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm NOC.  Was.  Now disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Why should I?
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Mm - Hmmm...
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Very good.
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
What was your deal with Job?
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the entire list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
Ten million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
What about Job?
I wouldnÃ�t worry about him.  Once youÃ�ve got the money -- heÃ�ll find you.
What sector's the air conditioning?
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Let's move!
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
IMF mainframe.
In Langley.
Zero body count.
Time up.
We're not outta here yet.
My contact is extremely shy.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jack.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Always.
Give me the God damn gum.
Jack.  Jack.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Stairway, youÃ�re wrapped, go to transport.
Higher.  Higher.
Right, right.  Good.
Jim.  Jim.  HeÃ�s in the open.
Jim we canÃ�t.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, IÃ�m coming to you.
No, weÃ�re going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
I thought I was going to see Max.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  After this one.
I thought I'd take some now.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Oh?  What's the problem?
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Tell you what?
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev?
What problem?
I guess.
Ethan, you can't burn out.
Why not?
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
How was Chicago?
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?  She says no. Oh
You're going to use Walter?
He's our guy.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Sure.  If the main character does.
If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
IÃ�ve got a shadow.
No.  Abort.
Negative, GolitsynÃ�s on the move.
TheyÃ�re covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
and picked us up in the States -
but you left before I could get there And I could check just so many places..
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
so I watched Europe. once you showed up in England..it was easy.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
I remember..
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  Kittridge!
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Yeah.
How did Kittridge do it?..
We donÃ�t have to, Jim.  HeÃ�ll come after us.
WhatÃ�s going to make him do that?
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. IÃ�ll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking IÃ�m dead and gone.  God knows what sheÃ�s had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
YouÃ�re probably right.
I usually am.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  IÃ�ll call you from Paris.
You got it.
And get a doctor.
Good luck.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
They stamped it, didnÃ�t they?  Those damn Gideons.
I knew about Jim.
Keep counting Claire.
ArenÃ�t you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
DonÃ�t flatter yourself - six was for Eastern Europe.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
YouÃ�re wrong about one thing.  IÃ�m not the only one whoÃ�s seen you alive.
Ethan - IÃ�ve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
This wasnÃ�t what we discussed.
WhatÃ�s the problem.
Try it again.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Phew!  WeÃ�ve got five minutes...
Where's the money?
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Right, partner.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah.  Right.
Where's the goddamn car?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You just drove by it.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Shit.
Adam, where are you?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
What did you say?
Who fired everyone?
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
I'm going home.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
Someone's shut off my money!
I know.  Where are you Adam?
What do you mean you know?
And?
You're broke!
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Cynthia...what's going on?
It's been a very strange day.
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Will you meet with him?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
I'm just offering a place to stay.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
So what's the problem?
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
Howdy!
Howdy to you.
Beautiful night.
Yeah.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
No problem. What's on your mind?
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
Sure.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
I agree with what you said...truly.
What did I say?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
Okay, I'm thinking.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
One.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I understand.
You're an understandin' fella.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Okay.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
So, what did they say?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Well, I ...
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called tits and ass.
I...
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
No, I don't.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
I can hardly wait, Coco.
I told ya.
Wow!
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Your Aunt called me.
I was afraid of that.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Sweetie, look at me straight.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Right. See ya.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Are you okay?
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Yes.
Very pleased to meet you.
Hi.
Betty.
You're still here?
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Can you tell me what happened?
Was anyone hurt?
Diane?
But it said 
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
No ..........I.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
I think I've been hurt.
Oh...
No.
But, this could be serious.
No...I need to sleep.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
What is it Rita?
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
What's wrong?
I don't know who I am.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
What do you mean?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
I don't know.
You don't remember anything else?
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
Unh, unh.
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Mulholland Drive.
Mulholland Drive?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
No.... I don't...
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Okay... but just...just to see.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Okay.
There's nothing?
Not that I can see.
No. Just the coffee.
We'll take our check.
Strange to be calling yourself.
Call the number.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
What's wrong with that?
I'm not sure about this.
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
You're still here?
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
Really?
My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left...
So... surprise...
I can call them... I can call my dad...
But you won't...
You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work.
You know what I want...it's not that difficult.
Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything...
What about you? What will your dad think about you?
Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Then they'd put you in jail.
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
I'm all right.
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Okay.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
Don't stop!
What is it? What do you see?!
Those men in front, in the car.
Do you know them?!
No... but...
Keep going. Go around to the back.
I don't think...
No.
But I want to.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
Wally Brown.
No, we don't.
What?
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
No class...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
More or less...
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not the greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
What kind of pies do you have?
Which do you recommend?
No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
What did you think then?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
You got something you want to do?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Don't stop!
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
Divine intervention.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Who is we?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
How come you never talk?
Oh my God!  Sorry.
What?
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Tough titty, it's mine now.
You guys stay on your bellies.
How is it?
Do you have a back up.
Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
You ready, Donut?
Wagons, hooaaa!
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Yes.
Whose ratings were higher?
Yours.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
What I'd like to do---
How 'bout Manson?
Manson beat you.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
She doesn't talk?
Not to anybody. She sings.
She sings? What does she sing?
Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
I'm keen with anticipation.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
All right, Mickey.
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
Sorry about that.
Don't worry about it.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Let's do it.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Aside from the obvious?
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Then was it worth it?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Tell me about the purity.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
That's indescribable.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says who?
Says the United States of America.
When have they ever been right?
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
Okay, let's cut it.
I could go for a Coke.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Sure.
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Yeah, we have a van.
Out front.
Let me have the keys.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
No.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
We'll all be killed.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
On average forty million.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
Yes.
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
Got it.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
So, what now?
Just wait one fucking minute.
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
NO!!!
Yes.
Yes.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Where do the air ducts lead?
Take a wild stab!
The entire wing?
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
Next week's episode.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, no.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Roger?
Scotty?
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Wayne Gayle.
What the hell happened to you?
Two-thirty. Shhh...
Are you all set?
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
How 'bout Mallory?
I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
Tomorrow.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
How's it working, Scotty?
Slate it.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
But how can you say that?
Why?
How so?
But you'll never be whole again.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
By all means.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Is that her real name?
Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
I see.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Ya know, I was.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
It sure is.
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Lose 'em.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Two guys?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
I can't do that. Five guys.
Three.
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
And me.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Don't call my men assholes.
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Could we go with you and film it?
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
That was in style a couple years back, man.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
So, what do you do?
Silicon Valley?
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say no without ever using the word.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
You stay with me...
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
I don't follow.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
We had to finalize the deal.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
There'll be red flags.
What's this?
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
Let's just slow down for a second...
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Two million.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
The Anti-Christ?
Just the last three weeks.
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
It's getting there.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Just out for a while.
Oh, come on Dad...
I was doing it for them.
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Jesse, help!
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Where's Jesse?
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
We were back on.
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
Get outa here.
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
What about it?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Naw. Just killing time.
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Yeah, why?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
It was okay.
Who told you to choke up that way?
No shit.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Today? Started off great...
You remember your dreams, Grady?
Only the wet ones.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
Shut up, Grady.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
I'm sorry...
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
You're fucked in the head.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
What?
It's happening again.
How come?
Ah, nothing.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
You okay?
Let me look at your eye...
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.
Yeah.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
I know.
I figured you might like some help.
Yeah?
You know her?
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
I think it's sad...
Traumas of a ten-year old.
March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!
Wow...
Are you okay.
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Are you sure?
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Guess so.
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Who?
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
I don't know.
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to the other world and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
Make a left at this corner.
What about essential energy the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
It's a surprise.
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
What's this?
So, you feeling anything?
What do you mean?
I thought you might be able to make a connection.
C'mon, cut it out.
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
I feel like a jerk.
Anything?
Disappointed?
About what?
I'll get over it.
Yeah?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
Ghostbusters are fearless.
What is it - What's wrong?
Whoa!
What is it?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
It's gone now.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
yeah, I had a bad night.
You want to talk about it?
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
What about Luther?
What about Ganz?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
There's nothing to figure out.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Why won't you talk to me?
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
I killed him!  I killed him!
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Who, Jesse?
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
I can't!
Hi.
Hi.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says boo.
What's a King Pin?
What's so funny?
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
'Morning.
Huh?
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
Okay, I guess.
No.  I'm okay.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Morning.
Fine.
Mob?
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
So what? We hide, right?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
All of them.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Okay...thanks.
What's that?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Did she always have nightmares?
I'm serious.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
I'm sure you would.
I'll need to take her things.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Hi Mom.
I thought I'd wait for you.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
He's full of shit.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
Mom?
I thought I'd wait for you.
I had such an awful dream.
Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
Come on...
Good morning, Jennifer.
How's your hand?
They're healing up nicely.
Don't hold your breath.
No, she's right.
He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
What's happening?
He's close...
Whoa. What?
We're going to give him the money back?
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
To old friends.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
Do you still...see each other?
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
I -- I think so!
I used to live in this house.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
It's an amazing gift.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
He's real.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
Sure.
You like gymnastics?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
You did it the other night.
That was different.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
Freddy?
He's heavy in the halls...
Fuck that. We're going too.
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
What's that?
Nancy!
He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Let's try this way.
Are you okay?
I think so.
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Why is that?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Thanks, Max.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
Thank you.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
It's been a long time.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
It's over.  It's over.
Crossed over?
Tell me about the kids.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a boogeyman for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Anything?
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Oh God.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
What's that supposed to mean?
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Ms. Thompson.
Call me Nancy.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
You're late.
Didn't get much sleep.
Well, we've got --
Yes, tell us, Nancy.
All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
This is nice.
Never been here before?
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
Sorry.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Sounds like a rough time.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
I'm serious.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
That's what I know.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
With Hypnocyl?
That's right.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
So do I.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
To who?
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
Stop blaming yourself.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
Then maybe you're ready.
For what?
The truth.
Try me.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
I can do that.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
We can try again.
Everybody take five.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
What are we going to do?
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Who would know where they were hidden?
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
Nancy...
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
No...
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Your dreams?
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
Okay, straight talk only in here.
We can't get to her.  I've tried.
And what are they?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
Neil, please --
How do we get in?
We've got work to do.
You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
What?
We missed.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Jake...
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Somebody else is out here.
Science...I suppose.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
I beg your pardon?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
Freddy.
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
Cooling down.
Don't worry, it won't come to that.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I'm going home
Let's go, Jake?
Moonan. Here. Shit...
So what? We just stay clear of him.
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
Jake, I mean, come on --
Shit.
I told you, use less powder.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
I just don't know if this says, me. What's the fabric?
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
Well, this is just fucking great...
It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the Send? Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin.
You know what we're doing with the money.
And what about Big Al?
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
When?
Tonight. Just me.
So you took the rest of the night off...
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
How much we going after?
Two million.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
No, not whatever. You're either in or you're out.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
She up for this?
She's up for it.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says The code's fine
You sure?
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Calls?
We'll use the Euc.
Jake --
So that's it...
That's it.
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
I'd like this cashed, please.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
I have a good crew.
Minus one.
You can't cheat an honest man.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
I can't do that.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Because you killed one of my crew.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
You sure that's the reason?
I need you to stake me.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Excuse me?
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
I think I just broke my hand.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah. Guess not.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Something stupid.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Very much so.
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Help me.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
We're not cops.
That's not --
You interested in a little work?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
That was quick.
Luther's on the move...
No.  What's my cut?
You get an equal cut.
I'll worry about Customs.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Don't worry about it.
It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
You need to get a haircut.
What?
And some new clothes.
Why?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
You're just going to have to trust me.
I don't trust anyone.
Then show me how.
Uh... Everything okay?
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
He's gone.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Uh-huh.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Lighten up.
You told me to change my hair!
Did I miss something?
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Notice something funny about that bus?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Look at you... You want to go.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
How do you know I will?
Intuition.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Don't ruin this for me.
How do you deal with --
WHAT?
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
Glenn talked you out of it.
Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
He was looking out for you.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to fuck some sense into me.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on tonight, eight-thirty.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
I said not as a rule.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
And the one driving the other car?
Glenn Michaels.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
Lie face down on the floor.
Yes.
Yes.
You were both in the trunk?  Together?
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
They didn't tell me anything, they asked questions.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
I know a Glenn.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
You didn't visit him in prison.
He didn't want me to.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Did you know that when you married him?
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, Okay.  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Really.  Hm.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Till they got busted.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Who are you?
You're good.
Thank you.
Yes.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
His assistant.
I'm not dressed.
I don't know where he is.
It's Richard Ripley.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Why don't we talk about it later?
Where in the hell are we?
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
She's coming with us.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
Do we need him?
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, Oh
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
You're too late, Jack.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
You're right.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Sounds great.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
What about...
What about the money?
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
What?!
You better come see this.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Jack?
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Shit.
Nice disguise.
I'm a tourist.
You at least bring the gun?
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
Uh-huh...
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Now you're talkin'.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
No, I want my cut!
Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying.  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
Love is funny.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Or two.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Outside of that.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
How long were you with the girl?
Forty-five minutes.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
Now that's a really big house.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- alone.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and done it.  Do you?
What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
You might not have a choice.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
I saw Karen Sisco.
Sorry. I didn't know...
And she saw you?
Yes, she did.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
Yeah, I did.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
I don't know.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
Whatta you wanna do?
You know they gonna set us up.
I get that feeling, yeah.
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
Half for doing what?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
I don't ski.
Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around.
They found the safe.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
They look like plain old rocks.
They sure do.
Come on.
Shit.
What?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
You got my cell. Leave a message.
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
We made it, didn't we?
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
Jack --
Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
You talked to him?
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
It was an unusual experience.
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
And what happened to Carl?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
I have to qualify, is that it?
You have to know what you're talking about.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
You'll have to ask him.
Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
Shut up.
Daniel.  Listen --
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
Sure, Daniel.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
That's all I wanted to know.
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
You get the key?
They're in 7D.
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
The manager's door is metal.
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Call and tell you.
And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
Leave it where it is.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
You don't, huh?
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
You excited?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Ironic, isn't it?
How are you, Raymond?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
You tell them the Tale.
No, I want my cut!
Quite a mess.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Who?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
No, I didn't know that.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Who was the friend?
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
I'll need a last known address.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
Hello?
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Oh-kay...
Karen, I told you not to--
Wait, I know him --okay?
Sign says Shut the fuck up.  Or can't you guys read?
There a problem, Foley?
Yeah.
That's right.
How much for your company at chow?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I bet.  How much?
Another C.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
I don't smoke.
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Low class of people there, Snoop.
Tick-tock...
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Your mess.
Then shut up.
My place.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Glenn didn't tell you?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Let's go outside and talk.
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
We're leaving.
The fuck you talking about?
I thought everything.
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
I wasn't asking permission.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
So you've done this before, huh?
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
Hey.  You learn from doing.
You know how to use one a these?
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Good luck, Richard.
Someone down here?
Stop waving that thing around.
You sure we're clear?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Not until recently.
A little.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
You're right.  So why take a chance--
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
You comfy?
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
In my bag, in the car.
Boy, it stunk in there.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
So, what's your name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Why, are you famous?
How many was that?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
That's funny.
I thought so, too.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
You don't seem all that scared.
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Uh-huh.
We still talk, though.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Faye Dunaway.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Network.  Yeah, she was good.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Peter Finch.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
Bleeding on a country road.
It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
Nothing.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You'd probably tell me.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
You have to be kidding.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, Three Days of the Condor.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Yeah...
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
I mean, romantically.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Get your hands up and turn around. Now.
Shit...
You know who this is?
How'd you get this number?
Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
That's my dad.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
Why not?
Because you're having too much fun.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
Unless you wanna tell me.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
Whatta you mean we'll make it an island?
I just thought maybe you and me could--
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
I can go to the bar.
Don't leave me.
Those guys bother you?
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
Miles...
Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
You like bourbon?
Love it.
Is that how you think of yourself?
A girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
How far do we go with this?
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, What if I had stopped and said something?  It might happen only a few times in your life.
Or once.
Oh, God...
I called your room from downstairs.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
It would be worth the risk.
You like taking risks.
So do you.
You really wear that suit.
That's not what you were about to say.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
What were you gonna do with me?
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
You waved to me in the elevator.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
It's bad luck.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
You know I saw you on the street.
Where?
Outside Adele's.
You were going to see her?
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
I don't think we should get into that.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
You coming back?
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Why are you mad?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
I don't know.
You're not dumb.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
You think I'd shoot you?
If you don't, one of those guys will.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I told you, I'm not going back.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
You just did, for Christ sake.
You know what I mean.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
So.  What's your point?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
Oh, nuthin'.
Take your sunglasses off.
I see better with them on.
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
Wait in the car.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
In the trunk?
Weren't you expecting us?
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
She knew me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled.
Yeah?  She said that to you?
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
I don't know...
Whose blood you got all over you?
I thought you guys were busted.
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
I hear six.
Looks like tonight.
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
Meet me at my place later.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
I'm getting a ride.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Must be a real soft pillow.
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
Thanks for your help.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
Really?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
I know what you're talking about.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do you believe Glenn?
Of course not.
It's a big house.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
It's a little late for me.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really want to change, it's never too late.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As security, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
The fish?
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
What's to think about?
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
How, Dick?  The way you earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you were nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying sign in here please or hey
Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally relaxed...
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
Foley?  That you?
How are you, Richard?
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Have they got Midge up there?
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
You gonna write me a check?
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
Five point two.
I were you, I'd get up and run.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
Hejira?  What kinda name is that?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The flight?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
You busted out?
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
That time?
There were others.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
The ninth?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Hejira.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
She did, huh.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Like what?
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
Glenn?
We're working for the King.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
You don't remember me, do you?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Do we have a gun in the car?
I remember you now.  Shit.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Wait.  Have you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Take the next exit.
What am I supposed to do now?
Glenn, take the exit.
No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
You're not?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
And is Foley a part of this?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Why's that?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
You crazy, come up here?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Uh-huh.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Someone?  Gimme a hint.
It's a guy you know.
It's Richard Ripley.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
What do we need another Shill for?
Breasts.
You there?
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't you here?
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting you in on this, not all your friends.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Can I do what?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
What-- when?
Right now, son.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
That was some shit, huh?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
Why would I do that?
Hi, Ray.
How's it going?
Why?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Oh...
You're a fighter?
I can tell.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Flyweight.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
Moselle Miller?
I'm looking for Maurice.
That's not Maurice?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
No.
No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
He said he stayed here last November.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Your dog was killed?
What did you call it?
The State Theater?
Uh...
What?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Good point.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
Something better.  Open it.
It's beautiful.
Thanks, Dad.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
He's still married though, huh?
He's about to.
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
No thanks.
Dad...
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I really gotta go.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
You were talking in your sleep.
What'd I say?
Hey, yourself.
Huh.
What are you thinking about?
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
He doesn't even look like that.
No?
No, he looks a lot...
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
I see that.
Was it Foley?
Off a tip?
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
Foley kidnapped me.
Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
It's late, they're closing...
Don't worry about it.
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like twenty-five to life pissed.
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
He waved to you?
You wave back?
I didn't have time.
I imagine you would've though.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What I want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
None I'd like to share.
You gonna go get him?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
My little girl, the tough babe.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
Out for the evening?
You here all by yourself?
Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
How do I look, mama?
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
Likewise.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, Undercover?
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Thank you...
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
What?
I think it's Dunn & Bradstreet.  But then, I could be wrong...
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Well, I need that...
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
Faux goose down.
Still...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Are those my suits?
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Midge.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.
Where the fuck is Foley?
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
...the fuck is this...
Him.
You sure?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Where the hell is she?
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, You're fired! Your whole team's fired! He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
What do we do? We change the scam?
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
Escorts!
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
And we got rid of the red head.
Jake? Customs?
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
I'll find the time.
King ain't gonna like this.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
What'd he say?
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
You're a weasel.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
That was fucking deep.
Do I get to kiss her too?
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Keep it up.
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
What?
Stand up.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
What happened?
Eee Oott Auught!
Sorry. What?
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Pretty much.
Pretty much.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
A little bit of both.
Can't say.
The King.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Ten percent.
Confidence. It's just confidence.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
I try.
Just a tip.
Is he gonna be okay?
Just until he heals up?
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Zowie...
Zowie.
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
There's a better place...
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
The old Indian burial ground.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
He was dead. You know he was.
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
Maybe it takes a while...
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
You ever think about running away?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Hey, there she is...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Partnership?
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
You okay?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Don't wanna miss this.
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Bottle-count.
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Bring the light!
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
What whispers?
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Show me your eyes.
You did this? To yourself?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him doctor.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Look deeper.
Power cells.
They're coming.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Entered our minds.
I asked what you thought.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
Why, what'd you hear?
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
Had it with deals.
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Saw something I didn't like.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
Think about what?
What about her?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Back to the ship, huh?
So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
How many you see?
One or two.
Audrey?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
As fast as you can.
You sure you can keep --
As fast as you can.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Riddick? How close?
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
We can't make it.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
What, you're afraid?
I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
Just come with me!
Got a better idea. Come with me.
They're already dead. Get on board.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
No, you see, I promised them...I have to...I have to go and....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
You'd die for them?
I would try for them.
You barely know them.
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
This is it? Booze? That's what you have to drink?
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
There....
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
What, switch what?
Hey.
Hey, me. Over here.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
And him?
Big Evil?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Only around humans.
S'matter?
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Which means he went toward sunrise.
Tell me it's not a mirage.
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Probably right.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Better keep moving....
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
So now you know.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Didn't bite.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
Shut up.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Like what?
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
He used that?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I assume he licked it clean.
I know what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Let's just be sure.
I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
We're gonna find the body, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Well, don't ask me to.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
Little ratty-ass.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
How many?
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Wha'?
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Let's wait on the power cells.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
We're not sure when it happens, so let's not --
Get the fucking cells over here, Johns. What's the discussion?
He can pilot?
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
That's what I said.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he stops believin' --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
Dancin' on razor blades here...
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
I never said I was.
Never said you were a hype, either.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you born lucky?
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Anything else we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Smoke screen for what?
For your own fear.
How much you weigh, Johns?
How much?
79 kilos.
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can't come up with a better plan.
We're just burnin' light here.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
So you noticed too?
We aren't completely stupid.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Hey, you're the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a whipped dog?
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
This does not help us, Johns.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Just shut up, okay?
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
We cannot go through there....
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Company's not here, is it?
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! That's how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
Owens!
I don't suppose....
Some prophet guy?
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Frightening thought.
For now.
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
Imam. Slow down.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
Do what I say. Please.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Which half?
And pointless.
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
I'm born-again.
Those suns gotta come back sometime. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
Listen to her? Her? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
...then we saw this.
King Tut's tomb....
A toast to whatever he just said.
What the hell are these?
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Very big beads.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
Say that again.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
I'd rather piss glass.
Well, you got the big gauge.
Think about that reward, Johns.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Fuck me. You said clear.
Well, what's it look like now?
Looks clear.
Such as.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
About the girl.
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
No. She's not.
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Just realized that, huh?
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Not if I'm the one.
What if you're one of five?
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called triage
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Trawl with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Nice embellishment.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
So which one caught your eye?
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
What do you care?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What, you 'spect me to do it?
What's one more to you? Like this is the one that sends you to Hell?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
What, it's broken?
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Dr. Zaius --
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
How did you know we'd come here?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
I apologize.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
Seal the cave?
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
The best. But we won't need them.
As you wish.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Right now, if you like.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
What are you doing there?
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
There's nothin' to talk about.
Do you have to work tonight?
Neither do I.
What's so special about him?
Remembers what?
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Where did you learn to do this?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
No, they won't -
It's probably wrong --
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
How did it go?
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Of course.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
What is your proposal?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Of course.
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Do you believe him?
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Where are they now?
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
What?
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
Thanks.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
And that's why you never went pro?
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Not yet.
Friends of yours, huh?
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Thanks for stepping in.
De nada.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
Where?
Come with Tyler.  She knows.
Don't you gamble?
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
How you figure?
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
One shot stopping.
Ever done this before?
Once.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
My man!
Utah, you copy bruddah?
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You do it... you first!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
You first!
Okay!
What's this?
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
You're a fucking dead man--
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
Talk.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
We're wasting time.
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
I'm not armed.
But you're not alone.
Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
Where's Roach?
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
I say when it's over!
The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
Why should I?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
Three seconds... two... one...
SHIT!!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
You never were...
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
Yes, sir.
Sir?
Zero distortion, sir.
Not so far.
Fine.
A little mushy.
Babes.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
I'll keep it in mind.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
The shit they pull, huh?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Good move.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
They don't go for the vault?
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
Sorry.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Johnny, it's the only way.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Thanks, buddy.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Right here, partner.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Got it.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Angelo, we gotta talk.
... so I started tailing him.
This Zen master surfer.
Did he rob it?
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Time for lunch.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
The hell are they?!
They took a left at the next light!
You sure?!
Nothing?
Nothing.
I know where they're going.
Figured you did.
Kid, get outta the way!!
NOOO!!
What do you want?
Shrimp and fries.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
I need you to teach me.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I'm serious.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
This gonna take long?
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Sure.
Nice place.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Who's the girl?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Meaning you were expendable.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
Sure, he's the Bodhisattva.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What are you talking about?
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
What's goin' on?
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
You had enough?
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Look at you.
What?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
You don't have to.
Those are cold.
I... I gotta go.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
You're kneeling on my hand.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Tyler, put the gun down.
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Well, I saw you and--
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
My name's Johnny Utah!
No way, old buddy.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
You're wastin' your time.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Right behind you.
Thanks.
What, Sergeant?
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
We both got scores to settle.
I lost them, that's what happened.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
I didn't have the time.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
You out to buy a motel?
No.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Oh.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
Look at the picture. Please.
No. At least I don't recall.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
What?
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
Don't know where she got Marie
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Tell me all about her.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
How early?
Very early. Dawn.
Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.
No one met her?
No.
Or arrived with her.
No.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
No.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
No! Of all...
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
Back where?
What do you mean?
You said she was sitting back there
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
What?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Cash.
And when she left, she never came back.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
She isn't still here, is she?
Not at all!
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Anyone at home?
I live there. Alone.
Someone is sitting in that window.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Of course not.
If she paid you well?
Now, look...!
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
No. I told you, she's confined...
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
Let's all talk about Mary.
Who are you, friend?
What's your interest?
Money.
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Why?
What are you talking about?  What is this?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
I don't believe it.  Do you?
I don't know.
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Casharoonie!
Sam, if she's here...
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
She stole some money.
Forty thousand dollars.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Yes.
Did he say anything about my sister?
I still feel...
I don't know.
May I talk to you?
I'm Mary's sister.
Is Mary here?
Is something wrong?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Here?
With you.
Where?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
What's the matter?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
A good reason, I suppose.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
I was getting to that!
What do you know about it?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
What thing?
What thing could we be in together?
I hate tears.
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes.
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
No.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
She haven't even called you?
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
You've led a charmed life.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
You want me to stay here?
She'll need both of us.
Where... can I stay?
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
It's been three.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
I feel better when you feel better.
Where's the old highway?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Yes.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
An hour! Or less!
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
Probably on his way back right now.
Sam, I'm going.
You'll never find it.
Stay here.
Why can't I go out there with you?
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Just wait here?
Contemplate your... panic button.
Sam.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Where could he have gone?
Without calling me?
In a hurry.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Who's he?
Our Deputy sleeps.
Well?
No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Yes.
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
You're not.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
Neither will I.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Of course we will.
Alive.
Where'd you go to college?
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
She was willing to lick the stamps.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
This is the old highway.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Huh?
You going to wait here for me?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I believe it.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
I'm glad we didn't.
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What makes you sound so certain?
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
Hospital clean.
What is it?
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
You can't go up there.
Why not?
It's regular. Okay?
I could stand something regular.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
We could laze around here a while longer.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
For what?
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I can come down next week.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
All right.
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with Bates' Motel printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there....
You have something most girls never have.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
You eat like a bird.
Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats like a bird
Uncommon, too.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
What are you running away from?
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
To a private island, like you?
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse someplace.  Put her in Someplace!
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Thank you, Norman.
You're not going to... to your room already?
Phoenix?
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Alright, Miss...
That's it.
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
We have a problem.
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Just coming up to ring for you.
I suppose you want a cabin.
I'll take you to...
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
It isn't necessary.
I'll get your bags.
Haven't any.
I'll show you the cabin.
Looking for me?
Satisfied with your cabin?
Fine.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Yes.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
And now that your mother's dead?
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
Right, that checks out here.
My mother is not dead!
I didn't think so.
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
I don't know what you've been saying.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Was that all?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
You didn't find anything.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
No mother.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Yeah.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
Eventual supernova.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
Look, bomb...
I think he's talking to it.
Yes, why?
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
What are you laughing at?
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
Did you? Where?
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
You would.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
But what about lunch?
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
There's no hurry. It's early.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
I think so.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
Delighted, I'm sure.
The key!
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
Where is it? What did you do with it?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
I won't let you say that!
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'd call it stupid at any time.
So that's the way it is?
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
Thank you.
But I think these things are beautiful.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
But it was really my fault.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Let me go! Let me go!
Ralph! Ralph!
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
The body of Joan Gale!
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Meaning what?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti!
Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You give me a pain!
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
And they never proved anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Nope, I'm through!
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Get out of here.
Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
It didn't go off.
It didn't go off.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
I am right! I know I'm right!
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Now don't that call for an extra!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
What!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Let it go.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is.
What do you mean?
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
No kiddin'?
Almost certain.
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
That's what I said.
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Call the Homicide Squad!
How's every little thing?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
No kiddin'.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
They don't suspect him?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
What does that prove?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
Make it snappy, Colonel.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
It's all yours.
Thanks.
Yeah.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
We've got to disarm the bomb.
Doolittle, are you there?
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Fine, thanks.
Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before --
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
That's what I said.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
I see. Was that all she said?
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Who'd steal her body?
That's what they're going to ask you.
What was that, I didn't hear...
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it.
Why?
You go in for dangerous things.
Darned if I don't!
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
How much money have you got?
Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
What the hell?
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Time to start talking.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Thanks.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Fuck that shit.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Well, there's the possibility of...
All right, then...
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
I read the same here.
Rechannel all safety relays --
-- open quantum latches --
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Talby, can you read me?
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Arm yourself, bomb.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Armed.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
No.
You are false data.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Snap out of it, bomb.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
Hey, bomb...
And I saw that I was alone.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
I'll help you out.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Of course.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
Well of course I exist.
But how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Right!
This is fun.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
Exactly.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That's it.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Why don't you have more time?
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
To explode, of course.
And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Hmmm...
So if you detonate in...
...nine seconds...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Pinback...
Yes, Doolittle.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
In a second.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
Naah. All stable.
What are you gonna name it?
What?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Shit.
Commander Powell would have named it.
Commander Powell is dead.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Fred.
Wha?
I hereby name this star Fred.
Out where?
Veil nebula.
Who cares?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- open circuit breakers --
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
Remark.
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
Oh, sure.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
I need a diameter approximation.
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
I like it up here.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
Billy Bear...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Not now!
Doolittle! Help me.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
What happened, Doolittle?
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Guess you're right.
Phoenix?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
That's correct, sir.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Well, what you might try is --
Who are all these?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sorry.
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Sir?
Talk to the bomb.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Sir?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
One of  em's in the slam.
So do you...been a long day.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
We kept it...
Is that right?
Leaving...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
Well I don't!
And I don't believe you...
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
So where do you go from here?
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
I'm up for that...
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
And who are you?
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
Which leads us to...
And then...
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
It's been known to happen.
Not to me, you know that.
I thought I did.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
Nothing.
What in bloody hell is going on?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
From Interpol?
That's him.
Lose them!
About time!
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
They're good!
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Do I need to repeat myself?
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
You were a soldier, were you?
Once.
Hazard pay...
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
I still am.
Is that right?
That's right.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
Nobody's saying they don't.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  Send the girl to do it.  Tell The girl to take care of it.  Have the girl fuck him.  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
I better be getting that.
Duty calls?
Just business.
Now, what did we steal?
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
I'm a patriate.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I didn't say I was.
Are you alright?
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
You sure about this?
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Next.
Where's the case?
That fucking figures...
Don't do it, Sam!
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
Do you have it?
What do you mean?
Here's yours.
What's that?
I take it you still want the money...
Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
What's a little hate between business partners?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Bullshit!
Then where is it?
Sent it where?
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Of course.  Don't you?
Not exactly.
How did you know?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Soon.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
I didn't expect that he would.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
So this is what, a test?
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
So what is it you want to know?
Created?
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Long enough to shoot back.
My way is better.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
Did he bring that with him?
Perhaps the police?
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
Cigarette?
He trusts you to lock up?
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Coordinate what?
Things.  This is my country, you know.
Where to?
To see a man about a thing.
I can do that.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
That's what I thought.
He says this is their block.
As in, they own it?
Something like that...
What'd you say to him?
I asked if we could give him anything else.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
What's the difference?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
I do.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
There is that.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
So is the woman.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I wanted to see who you were.
Who am I?
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
Lovely, isn't it?
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
What's going on?
I just wanted to see something.
See what?
I needed to know.
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
Well I ain't a cop.
How did you know?
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
Because that's what I would have done...
The question still remains: what do we do now?
Gregor's cell phone...
What's going on?
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
You were smoking?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
I borrowed that, too...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
It was at that.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
He's going back.
It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
But you can't.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
Not exactly.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
And what job is that?
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I'm going with you.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Yes I do.
Alright, it's done.
You see the bullet?
Clearly.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
You know him?
I know of him.
The Irish representative?
What's this?
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Thorough man.
You sure your friend got the right place?
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Do what?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's my job.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
Dark ops?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
It is at that.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I never made that claim.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
You were behind the door?
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
You would have done that?
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
How could you have done that?
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
They don't have the package.
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
What the fuck happened?
I don't know...
You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
Right now?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
I'm not here very much.
Business keeps you on the road?
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
So I do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Time to quit.
Just like that?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Would you stop with that...
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
Because I don't walk away.
Why not?
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
That's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?
No, I don't.
I'll work on it...
Let's get him out of here...
Finish the job...
And now...
Finish it!
You son-of-a-bitch...
What?
What of it?
Your field dressing saved his life. That's three I owe you.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
What happened to it?
Gone.  Destroyed.
I guess that's for the best.
I told you, I quit.
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
What's the story?
Gaelic.
I'm sure.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill her?
You slept with her!
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You slept with her!
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You slept with the fucker!!
I'm alright.  And you?
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Do you have the tape?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
I got to wait for a call.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
What?
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
What the hell is that?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
What?
All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
El Capitan?
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was Red Dragon.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Yeah, that's right.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
So what's your story?
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
That's right.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
No.  It's my first time.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Those girls drove off because of you.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
I said that?  Which word was goat?
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Carter, would I lie to you?
No.
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
No.
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Bathroom.
Carter, get off that stage!
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
I knew you were lying.
I'm sorry.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
You lied to me.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
This won't take long.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
I am a tourist.
Hello.
How you doin'?
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
What are you doing?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Well, hurry up.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
This is a very dangerous man.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
I'm calling for back up!
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Don't look at my ass!
Where are you going?
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
It's my job!
I have plenty of dates.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Carter?
Who died?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Not Yu.  You!
Who?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
What the hell is going on here?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
No.  She's a school teacher.
Good at what?
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
Ask me if I give a shit.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
No, no, that would be crazy --
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
IT IS CRAZY!
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
What?
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
I cannot go to LA...
It sounds impossible --
You said --
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Follow the Rich White Man?
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Who?
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
You sound like that all the time.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
He'll be back soon.
How do you know?
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
It's a long story.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
No.  It was my singing.
Excuse me?
She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
What did you say?
Nothing.  I said nothing.
Is it hot in here?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
What's going on?
She's getting undressed.
No.  It's not right.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
What's she doing?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
What?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
I don't understand?
She's walking back towards the door.
Pick it up!
It's your turn!
I don't need a turn!
Wait!  There's people down there!
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
Take it!
I wouldn't do that!!!
It's a bomb.
Let me see it again?
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
She never even looked at you.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
She saved our lives.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
Shhh, my head hurts.
I'm about to be killed and you Shhh me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Why did you help me?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not used to having a partner.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
Well we're not friends.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
Fine with me.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
See you in the next world.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Fine.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Yes.  We have heaven.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
What's a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
I think we should stop talking.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
Mind your own business.
How was the sex?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Steamed dumplings?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
Very nice.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
Now that I believe.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
End of the line.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Red Dragon.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Let's go.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
What is Mac out?
Follow me my Asian brother.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Dancing?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Lee!
MMMMMM!!!!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
I did!
No you didn't!
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
What?!?!
We have to get to the Penthouse.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
Just GO!
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
It's worth it to me.
No problem.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
That your gate down there?
Yes.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
What is this?
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
It's okay, I got lots more.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
This money is evidence.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
New York City?
First class.
A little Mu-shu.
Some Kung-Pao?
I could use a little vacation.
Amen to that, brother.
What revenge is he talking about?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Fine with me.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Is this a payoff?
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
Put your arms around me.
Excuse me?
What's going on?
I need your help.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
Just trying to make it look real.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
Why don't you go get them?
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
How do I know I can trust you?
Dip me!
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Are you okay?
I didn't know which side you were on.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Do you still have the bills?
Any leads?
It's my responsibility.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Did you tell Sterling?
Thank you.
I'll take him.
You must come with me for questioning.
Don't.
The police can protect you.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Yes, Master.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Ricky Tan?
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my still.
You know what a phone booth is?!
Lee!  It's him!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
OK. Say what it is.
Sir, I can explain.
I know, but --
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Feds asked for me?
And that, of course, would be me.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
He stole my wheel!
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
Tell me about it.
You talk very fast.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Beach Boy.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
You have one of these?
No.
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
You speak English!
A little.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
What?
That silly-ass look on your face.
I was being polite.
Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
Witnesses.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
It was not my intent --
What about them?
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
You make the plate?
The license!  You get it?!
No.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Did you make the plate?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
No. I just made it up.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
Don't go there...
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Stooly.
What?
Stool pigeon.
Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
Come on!
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
Took off. Yes. They took off.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
You like it?
That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.
You want more?
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Ã®scuse me.
Yes, I know this song.
You know War?
Who does not know War?  â”‚War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.â–“
That's not how it goes.
Yes, I think so.
Yee-aww.
Good God, ya'll!
No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.
Are you OK?
Want some?
No, fish is a PM food.
Excuse me?
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
It's him.
Which one?
Going into the restaurant.
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
This concrete?  This is still America.
What do you hear?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
Like that.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
No, please, I don't --
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh yes.
Oh no, I dropped it.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Lee.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
What are you doing here?
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Oh no.
What?
The art.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
Oh my god. Griffin.
You know him?
What a surprise!
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my Ã®hood.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Not anymore.
Where'd you get it?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
The Feds?!
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
No...what?
I could get promoted right out of here.
What's wrong with that?
I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?
How'd what go?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Ã®em.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
It's called a dress.
It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
You don't like it?
It's okay. For restaurants.
You OK?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Not to me. Never to me.
How about a lift home?
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
How much they want?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
He is the situation.
I'm talking about the girl.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Carter, shut up!
Yo, Johnson...
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
That's what you were supposed to be!
Hmmmm?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
What?!
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
Where do we find him?
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Carter, can I have a moment?
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Ã®em.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
I still have work to do here.
I was trying to find the right time.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
When? How?
What am I wanted for?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I don't think your gun's loaded...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I still don't think it's loaded.
Bobby?
What?
Yeah.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
No, Why?
Hey, you're right.
That's the way I see it, too.
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Ride 'em cowboy)
Who wouldn't?
It's downright classy is what it is.
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Now that's down-right insulting.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
I'll see you tonight.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Oh God.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
How?
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Leave me out of this.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Ouch.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
What?
Go ahead.
It's not that easy.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Then leave.
I can't.
Why not?
You don't understand.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
I can't leave.
Fuck you.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Because he'll kill me.
Why don't you call the cops?
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
That's long enough to get out of town.
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
How?
Oh. Hi.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Don't worry. He's out of town.
How far out of town?
Never heard of him.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Like you?
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
And you admire that?
It's the only way to play.
Is that how you play?
I try.
: What are you up to?
Nothing.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
You really need to lighten up.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
This has nothing to do with him.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Therapy session is over.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Who is it?
It's me.
We been through that.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
You can still work.
Find a new job.
You always been this stubborn?
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Ass first into the world.
I been that way ever since.
Why not?
I just can't. Okay?
What's wrong, Danny?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
I can't tell you.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
They would have killed you too.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Really, I don't want to.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
What is it?
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
I don't want to.
Why?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Danny, it's not what you think.
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Oh shit
Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
It's Tom.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
How?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Guess it's our turn.
What time is it?
Twelve
Midnight?
Where to?
Nice day
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Why's that?
My features. They're Finnish.
You don't say.
Finland is a country.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
I'm hurting.
You on a roll?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Sorry.
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
That's a good one.
So, why'd you want to see me?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
What?
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Don't get carried away.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
Fuuuuuck
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Can you set that up?
Sure.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
10%.  That's ...
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
You wanna score some go-fast?
Not tonight.
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Palmdale
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
He doesn't have one.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
No  You think she's a tweaker?
You want a hit?
No. I'm good.
Can I ask you something?
Sure, Jimmy.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Yes, Jimmy
Danny?
Yes, Jimmy.
Thanks for not laughing at me.
What's this?
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
You aren't coming with me.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
Why?
Hey, check it out...
What the hell is that?
What?
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
But...I've seen you.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
No one ever noticed?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
And you want me to do you some big favor?
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Good for you Jimmy.
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
What does that mean?
You don't understand.
No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Crank or glass?
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
No, I'm good.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Not bad.
Secret recipe.
Can we talk price?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Hey, okay.
Anything for a dear friend.
But I just met you.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
If you say so.
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Hey, I don't play that.
You want to do this some other time?
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Come on, guys ...
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Big Bill
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
What?!
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Uh-uh-uh ...
Shoot him.
Okay! Okay!
Now get talkin'
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
Yeah.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
I'll keep that in mind.
What the hell is this?
Just some buddies.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Cool it. We got business.
Yeah, dickhead.
I'm all wet.
What's wrong with that?
I've got a hot one.
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
You think I'm a Judas?
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Thanks for not judging me.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
You don't find that repugnant?
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Tell me what?
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
When?
What the hell are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
Jesus.
Yeah.
My name is Tom.
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Answer the fucking question!
This the guy?
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
What's he holding?
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
Yeah.  What about him?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
The Mexicali Boys
And what does this have to do with me?
He knows somebody ratted him.
What?!
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
We know what's going on.
Jimmy?
He's the only one I told.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
What's on the other end of this thing?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
What's that smell?
That would be me.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Who'd have thought it?  Danny Chickenshit Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Excuse me?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
They have. But they never found a lab.
You're lucky, Flynne.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
You mean the menacing red car?
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
When is the deal going down?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
I was talking about Miles.
And you've got wiener breath.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, quit fucking around.
You think that's a good idea?
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Just admit you're wrong.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
That is so unfair.
Why are you doing this?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Don't we always take good care of you?
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Maybe he isn't showing.
What is it, drugs?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
I thought you were done.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
I guess he got the message...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I can do it, Captain.
How's the name search going?
Can't we hold him?
What now?
That doesn't work, sir.
Cotton.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
I did that.
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
Did it?
What?
Please, Cotton, donÃ†t do this.
ItÃ†s over, Cotton.
Did you do it?
You have a right to be angry.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Fair enough.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Good for you.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Home--where he lives.
Why don't you ask them?
No, I don't.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
I couldnÃ†t believe you didnÃ†t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
Jesus, youÃ†re just as whacked as your son.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
What are you going to do?
Enter Cotton Weary.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
I think he's doing Dolly.
Definitely Whitney.
Not one bit.
She dumped me.
Yeah.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I skipped. Too many That's her looks.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Sid, you don't have to.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
About what?
The forbidden subject.
Lemme take you home.
I'll get my jacket.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I think it's out of your control.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
It's under control.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
No, it's not.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
Go on, untie him.
No. This is a set up.
ThatÃ†s quick.
Why?
Two.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Where's Sid?
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
She's got guards with her.
What guy?
Randy somebody.
He seemed harmless.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
Need some help, honey.
I got it..
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
I really donÃ†t like that comparison, honey.
He hates Oliver Stone.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
YouÃ†d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. ItÃ†s a whole world, Sid. YouÃ†re really popular amongst the demented.
YouÃ†re the one who got away.
Until now.
Of course not. Who wants to? WhatÃ†s the point if we donÃ†t get caught? WhereÃ†s the glamour in that?
The way I see it. WeÃ†ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
And now, drum roll please...
A twist ending if you will.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thingÃ†s been done.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
And we didnÃ†t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneyÃ†s worth.
So we found a compromise.
Or it found us.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Just for you, Sid.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
Tails.
We had to have financing.
TuitionÃ†s expensive.
Hello, Dwight.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
I see you read the book.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Page 32. Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence. I think you've explained yourself.
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
You have every right to be upset.
Page 41. Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
I think you're all an act.
I know that.
Yeah?
Not good. How you doin?
Meaning?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
Billy had alibis too.
You broke my heart.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
And it's sexier in the dark.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
..and as lonely as I am...
We'd break some furniture.
They're roomates.
And Joel's pre-med.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Hallie?
Ssshh! What was that?
Let's find out.
This is all too familiar.
Over here.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
C'mon. Let's go.
Let's go.
No, wait here.
Dewey?
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Yeah, right.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Just in case...
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Humor me, Sid.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
Who is this?
Who are you?
I don't play games.
What do you want?
Where are you?
Oh--a God complex
What do you want from me?
What do you mean?
You're getting obvious.
No, wait...
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It's good to see you involved.
My morn was a Delta.
Sid, I'll come with you.
But who would operate your camera?
What?
Oh my God.
SomeoneÃ†s trying to kill me. I need the police.
Yes, goddammit!
I donÃ†t know.
The safety what? Fuck that!
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
I have rehearsal.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
Too bad.
He tried to kill her first.
What?
Don't do this.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Knock yourself out.
Hello?  Hello?
Time to change numbers again?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?
Gotta.
That was good.
Yeah, right.
Who is that guy?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
I'd really just like to be alone.
Can I come with her?
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Oh, Sid, youÃ†re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
Thanks, Joel.
But...
What do you want?
Do you work for her now?
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
Who is this?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
More of a game really.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Good bye Ben.
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
Closer than you think.
To see your reaction.
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
A note?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Who?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Please, call me Gale.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Four? There are five.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
Absolutely.
What do you know about trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Did you request this case?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
Hmm.
Oh yeah, how?
Yeah. A real tragedy.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Detective Kincaid?
The killer called her.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
No.
And what made you think it was Sidney?
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
What?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
I can see nothing's changed.
No.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Yeah?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Where are you Dewey?
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
Where's Gale?
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Show him.
They found another note?
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Why would the police come to you?
What about me?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
You used to say that was our strength.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Off the record.
Always.
And?
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Someone stole Sid's file?
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it?
Jennifer needs me.
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
I'm on duty.
Stop following me.
You're not a detective.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
What?
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Thank you.
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Do you want us to come with you?
I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
Sidney, what happened?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Who is it?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Your life?
Would you excuse me for a moment?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Who's phone?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Geez.
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
None.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
That's funny.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Need to get in that building?
No really?
There a story in that building?
Possibly.
Basements creep me out.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Bitch.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
They're the ones who approved it.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Just because you knew her?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Are you saying she was-
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, What's new
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Who's this.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
What are you talking about?
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!
Let's get out of here!
GALE WATCHOUT!
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
W-what do you want?
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Who is this?
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
Go there.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
How do I know their voices are --
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
You're dead!
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
WHERE?
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Yeah?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
I thought you wanted me here?
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Are you sure?
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Who the fuck is this?
What? She asked.
Sorry.
No one's saying you did.
Owwww...
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Sorry.
How'd you do?
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Duh... that's quick.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Oh...
Dude. What are you doing here?
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Oh yeah.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
And if you get it right -- you die.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Ready?
Yeah...
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
It's on the table.
No, it's not.
I thought she was dead.
She looked dead. Still does.
She can't get both of us.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Where the fuck did she go?
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
You rode your bike out there?
Yes, sir.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
Billy? What the...
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
You sleep in THAT?
My dad's in the other room.
I'll only stay a sec.
Close call.
What are you doing here?
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Oh it did?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid R rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
What's that?
Oh Billy... Please... God...
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Jesus, SHIT!
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
You know that's not true.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
No...
It's been a year since she died.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
You have to move on, Sid.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
It's okay. We need to talk.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
You lost your mom...
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Oh Sidney...
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Sshh... it's okay.
Or even a good porno.
What?
You heard me.
Are you serious?
Yeah... I think so.
Who did you call?
What?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
I called my dad.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Uh-huh.
You don't still think it was me?
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
I thought you were...
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
NO! Don't believe him.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Fuck you.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Why did you kill my mother?
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
Hello?
Are you alone in the house?
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Who are you trying to reach?
What number are you trying to reach?
I think you have the wrong number.
It happens. Take it easy.
Hello.
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
What?
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
Popcorn.
Uh-huh.
Just some scary movie.
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
No.
Why do you want to know my name?
What did you say?
That's not what you said.
Yes?
What do you want?
Dial someone else, okay?
No-bored.
Listen, asshole...
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
What do you want?
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
So you better leave.
How do you know his name?
Where are you?
Please don't hurt him.
Why are you doing this?
NOOO!
What kind of game?
Please don't do this...
No... please.
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
No...
I don't know...
Please..stop...
Michael... Michael Myers.
NOOOO....
...please... no...
No it's not. It was Jason.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
You tricked me...
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
And why is that? Has something happened?
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
No, not yet.
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Evening, ma'am.
Deputy... good evening.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Then what are you doing here?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Mind if I join you?
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
What kind of lead?
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Can I bring Kenny?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I like it. It's... sexy.
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
I don't think you're so bad.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
I'll call for backup.
I'll get my camera.
What are you doing here?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Does mom know?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Shit.
What is she doing here?
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
Did you reach my Dad?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
At the airport.
I don't know. I guess.
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Any word on my Dad?
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
You girls ready.
Yeah.
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Afraid not.
Not yet.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
How is everything?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
He's her boyfriend.
I was first to respond.
What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.
She's tough.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
What about the cellular phone bill?
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
She staying with you?
We haven't located her Dad yet.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Have you contacted the bureau?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
You think he could still be in town?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Yes, sir.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
What's the delay?
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
Yes, that's right.
How's the book?
It'll be out later this year.
I'll look for it.
I'll send you a copy.
I'm not here to fight.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Forget it.
Please. You owe me.
I owe you shit.
You owe my mother.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Many times.
Has his story changed?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
I saw him leaving wearing it.
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
I have no idea.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
So who are you?
So where are you?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Can you see me right now?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Hello?
LEAVEMEALONE!
Who are you?
Can you knock?
No you didn't.
Got it.
Have a good trip.
Stu was with me last night.
Working, thank you.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
She's the Scream Queen.
Stop. Right there.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Don't come any closer.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
You got it.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
For about two seconds.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
Besides --  Takes a man to do something like that.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
Jesus, this place is packed.
You coming tonight?
What?
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
The why'd the police let him go?
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
So what's his reason?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
She's saving herself for you.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
Which is you...
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
And what would be your motive?
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
I can cry on cue.
What's Leatherface doing here?
There goes my chance with Sid.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Wanna another beer?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Are you serious?
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game.
You're crazy -- both of you.
You'll never get away with this.
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
Do you believe this shit?
What happened?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
No way.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Do they know who did it?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
They think it's school-related?
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
How do you gut someone?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Thanks, Tatum.
Later.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
It's past seven.
I'm not worried.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Bye.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Just like old times, ain't it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
Do you really think Billy did it?
He was there, Tatum.
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
Take a message.
Come on, Sid.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Shit, what is he doing here?
I bet he's pissed.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
I don't know...
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
And you believe it?
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Come on, let's rock.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
Who?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing Eight is enough to fill our lives with love... He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
No way.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Deal.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I thought you dumped her for me.
I did. He's full of shit.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
For once, Stu, drop it.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
Tits -- see.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
What am I? The beer wench?
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Jack, are you okay?
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Come on, say it.  You know...
With you, my life began and with you shall it end...
I have to cut his windpipe...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Ellen, move aside...
Oh God, Tommi...
Stop that!
You'll never get away from me!
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
I mean the armchair!
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Maybe the antenna's broken.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Hey... the fuse.
Oh, damnit!
Do you know where fuse box is?
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Do you have a better idea?
You?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
Yes, daddy.
Where are you going?
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Making our very own solstice fire.
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
I just had a really strange experience.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Cherry-red Tears.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
I miss Tommi so much.
So do I, believe me.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Who was that?
Someone from the village.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Martin, it's not funny!
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
So, did you sleep good?
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Where have you been all day?
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Where have you been?
In the village.  Look what I found.
Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals...
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
Who's that?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
She was old.
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Maybe an animal.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
Hi, darling.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  There is something negative about the place...  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
What are you talking about-
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
What?
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
How did you get me out of there?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
For God's sake, what happened to me?
You don't remember?
Ellen.
Thank you.
I really hate to bother him, but...
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
But what is the truth?
Hello.  Can I help you?
No, I've never seen him before.
Do I look like it that much?
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
1976.  What happened back then?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
And that is?
I've killed my husband!
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Ladies and gentlemen: The Straub country-residence.
Tenth floor.
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Serve.
I was trying to educate you.
What?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
I haven't lost yet.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
Jack?  What was that?
He made it clear.
Only on expenses.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
Have you seen him?
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
No.
Can I show you something?
No.
Think about it.
No.
No.
You mean immoral.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You think so?
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
He's still here.
He couldn't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
And what about you?
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
So who's going to do it?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I can't do it.
I don't hear this.
I won't be able to.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
I just thought we should discuss it.
I don't know.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Finished.
But not quite.
Don't you worry about that.
Is this necessary?
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
That was good.
Can we talk about something?
Not now. I have an idea.
Just stop worrying.
I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Now.
After.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
You think so?
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much?
I don't know.
What is this?
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a break-in.
Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
What? Yes, that's fine.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're not eating.
Not eating what?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
Looking for you? Yes.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
We just wanted to speak to you.
Who?
Your friends.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
But they know.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
They know.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Except the money.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
So I gathered.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
Not at all.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
About the mail --
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
What?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
Cover it?
But there's no --
I don't know.
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
Is this being recorded?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
No. Why should it?
Well, then?
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Well, is it?
What?
Parked outside?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
Yes.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
I see.
Right.
What?
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
And you like it?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Cameron.
Cameron?
Yes.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
I thought you stopped going.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
She hated you --
Well, she had problems --
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Aroused and inflamed.
Alex.
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
Not usually this drunk.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
-- which is --
Which is a hack.
The man we know and love.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
Know and love?
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
You see, they don't really know me.
Have you seen Hugo?
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
David?
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
So?
Open it.
You want me to kick it open?
Yes.
Now?
Yes.
All right. No problem.
I wonder how he did it?
Did what?
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Alex.
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Don't.
Don't look?
No.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Is that all?
I don't thinkI can.
OK.
David?
Be careful.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Stop nagging.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Sshh.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Who?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
No, I don't.
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
You were magnificent.
Hello. Hello.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Are you all right?
No.
Then let's spend some money.
Will you calm down.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
You know we're right.
Don't you?
I don't see the point in that.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
Leave him alone.
He can't stay up there.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
We have to talk.
Your painful groin?
Later. But first -- him.
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Oh, good.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Forget it.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
And the money?
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Expecting anyone?
Oh.
Aren't you going to answer it?
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
It's the only way.
You're frightened.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
You'll wait in the hall?
I'll wait there.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Alex.
What?
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Are you all right?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
We were just sorting things out.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
Oh, shut up, Alex.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
That's what I thought he said.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Don't you ever stop?
No.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
Interesting.
I see.
So, uh...
What?
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
It's OK. There's no problem.
You mean I can have the room?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
Can you afford this place?
Yeah.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
What about?
It's about the burglary.
Burglary?
Of course.
Can we come in?
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
There are only two other people in the flat.
Who said there were four?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
No, three. Who said there were four?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Yes, absolutely.
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
I see.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Someone lost the key.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
You're sure of that.
That wasn't a question.
Why do you want a room here?
Do you smoke?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Did you ever kill a man?
Just a second, that's all!
Just get on with it, Alex.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Is this what they always look like?
Yes.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Are you all right?
Would you like to talk about it?
No.
Do you know many of these people?
Yes. They're my friends.
I'm sorry.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
That's what it cost, David.
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
Expecting anyone?
What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
No.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?
If I think you're lying --
I thought you'd gone to work.
With a face like this?
I should hope so.
We already know. All about it.
You and me?
Yes.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
It wasn't like that.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Sorry?
Right here?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Exactly what I was --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Eh --
I'm not sure --
Yes, sir.
I'm boring?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Hello.
What guy?
What guy that died?
Here?.
You must be Hugo.
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to come in?
I'd be delighted.
It's nice.
Would you like to see the rest?
What do you do?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
What's it about?
I see.
No.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
Writing seems easy.
It's a breeze.
Do you think you could answer that?
The telephone? It continues to ring.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
No.
All right.
It was some guy called Brian.
Did he sound upset?
It's an improvement.
Shall I answer it?
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
A certain weakness.
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
And that's not the same thing?
No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
What?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
The first one was fine.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Look again if you like.
No. I haven't seen them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Same as everyone else.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Diseases.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I suppose so.
Sorry?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Or a fake?
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hiya, kid.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Yes?
I'm hungry.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
You mean they ate each other up?
They had to, in order to survive.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
How's it going, Doc?
Okay.
Are you having a good time?
Yes, Dad.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Yes.
Do you feel bad?
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Dad?
Do you like this hotel?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
I guess so.
Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Dad?
What?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
No.
French Fries and Ketchup.
You real down?
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Yeah.
Chocolate.
I'm not supposed to.
Tony.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Yes.
I don't know.
Maybe he showed me something.
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Okay.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Jack...
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Yeah.
Danny, come on over here.
Yeah.
Okay.  You behave yourself.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Okay...oh!
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Yeah.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
It's so pretty.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
No.
Mom?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
I won't make any noise.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
I won't, Mom.
Okay, Mom.
Danny?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Mommy...
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Danny!
Mommy!
Oh!
No.
Yes.
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Talking to Tony.
No.
Because he hides.
To my stomach.
Do I have to?
Shall we go into the living room?
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Tony.
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Fine.
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
And, er... where are they now?
Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
No.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger!
A nigger cook.
How?
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Grady... oh.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
Nice to meet you.
I'm a Wendy.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Sound good to you, Danny?
Pleasure to meet you.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Well, I'm looking for a change.
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
No charge?
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Hi, babe.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Uh...huh.
Sure is.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Perfect for a child.
Yeah.
What time is it?
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I know it.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Yes.
Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Yes.
Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
Did you find anything?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Yes, I did.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
How do you know?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
He's still asleep.
I think he did it to himself.
Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
Jack...
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
How do you like it?
I...
You can't remember.
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Yes...
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible.
Of course I am.
Of course you are.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Stay away from me!
I just want to go back to my room.
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me,
Wendy!
Stay away...!
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stay away from me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Stop swinging the bat.
Get down.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
I'll bring back a doctor.
I'm gonna go now.
Mr. Ullman?
Yes?
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Have any trouble finding us?
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Oh, it sure would be
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh...
five months of peace is just what I want.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
can of itself be a problem.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
They'll love it.
Great...
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I don't believe they did.
Well, my predecessor in this job
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
shut in together over long periods of time.
Well, that is eh quite a story.
Well, obviously some people can be
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
I'd better collect my family first.
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
Well, it's very... homely.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Royalty?
All the best people.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Oh, I'll say.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Thanks.
Thank you, Susie.
Hi.
Hi.
How're you getting on?
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Yes.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
What time does the plane leave?
Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Stop it!
Yes. Go away.
Where's Mom?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Will you marry me, Jane?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Well... it is his third.
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
What?
What kind of noises?
Rats...
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Mom-!
Yeah.
No.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
What if it's some kind of monster?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
What?
Do I need one?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
I don't get you.
Sure.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
Yeah... sure.
Was it a prescription?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Well... was it a prescription?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
I told you!
I told you!
There! You see!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
I saw what I saw.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
Will you do it?
But Uncle Al! You said-
What if I say no?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
So what?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Whaddya think?
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Let's go, Reggie.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Who took the meat?
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
How did you hear this?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Two days... ?  For murder?
I hit him square.
I was afraid of this.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
To place it inside its coffin.
No bleeding.
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
What are you spying on?
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
He is a behemoth.
A diseased monster.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
... Brom Bones...
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
Bring Young Masbath here.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
You need rest.
You will stay at her side?
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
Stains of blood.
What?
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
Pardon me?
Do you have these persons' wills?
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Master Hardenbrook...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
I could determine if he were dead before he went into the Hudson.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
Chosen me?
I shall, gladly.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
The militia?
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
Believe?
What is that you wear?
Well... so much for common sense.
I know it.
At times I do.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I manage fine alone.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I did not ask you to, did I?
What is the common thread between these victims?
I'm sure I don't know.
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
How could he?
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
Where are we going?
Up.
What is it?
The Western Woods.
Look again.
What kind of nuts?
Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
It's spectacular.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
No, I couldn't...
I have others.  All I need is this.
Thank you.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Tell me.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Father said witches live there.
Witches do not exist.  However...
What is it?
I hear nothing.
We are leaving.
What happened?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
How could something named the tree of the dead fail to draw attention?
We should not go much further in this murk.
Should we go back?
We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
What is it?
Stay back.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
We should go.
Why this tree?
Man or woman?
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Yes.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What does it mean?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  Paasch
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
Lady Van Tassel.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
No.  They are all missing.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
What books?
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
What now?  Where is she?
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir?
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Why... why are you like this?
This is farewell.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
Lady Van Tassel...
I know.  Hold on.
What can we do?
What now?
How are you?
Tired.
Forgive me, I didn't know.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Other people?
Small talk.
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
My suitor?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call friend
He has proposed to me twice.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was no at least once.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
You are funny.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
It would be interesting to find out.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
You made this, and the drawings?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
I insist that you have it.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
You promised justice.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
People have put their trust in you.
Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
Why would you do such a thing?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
What are you on about?
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
Must I hear this?
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
And this gives worth to butchery?
It was not butchery.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
But, why?  Tell me why.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
What troubles you?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
What has happened?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
What?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
It is only me.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
Blood.
What are you doing?
Just... keep where you are.
My God... what has happened?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
What... what are you doing... ?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
What is so urgent?
Come with me.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
It was you there?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
And, what did he say?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
What would you have me believe?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
Katrina...
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Where are we going?
He moves too fast.
What was that?
Ichabod...
Quickly, close it.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
I... I can't do this.
We have no choice.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Yes, actually.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Where?
Very little.  I must be going...
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
It is fine.  Now, I must...
Let her go!
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
There was not much blood, was there?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
Turn around.  Now!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
In a way, yes.
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
The Horseman.  Yes.
Can you help?
What... what are you doing?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
You... you are alive.
Father saw you die.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
You're impossible...
That's what I always say.
Who the hell are you?
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Shrink major, not a shrink.
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was human, yes?  Type B positive.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
Well, if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not own land.  So...?
Why?  If they could never take title.
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Did he see some danger from defen...
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
It is.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
All right, what if the defendant heard?  So Carl let him aboard, to help.  And then the fishing gaff?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
Up in the air?  Was that your reaction?
Why not?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people believe is true.
Well, it seems to me...
Doesn't it seem to you, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
It seems human.  To me.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
You're implying th...
I said.  No further questions.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
Why?  We're only talking.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
The Japs did it.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
There's no one here, and I've got to talk to you.
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
Look, I want to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Did you write that column?
I did.  But the jury won't s...
It's not for the.  They only get to convict him.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
Those aren't the facts that matter.
...but he found you.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
Well, what then, sergeant?
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
And the next one...?
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
And the last...?
Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Pretty darn clear.
Did you say more?
And why.  Is that?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
All right.  What did your son say to that effect?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Objection!
Your Honor, all of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
Tht was summation, Your H...
Objection!  Speculation.
Everything had to happen just right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
But isn't the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces.
Oh, yes.
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
Like you couldn't believe.
Greedy.
He didn't want to lose any more.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
That's curious.  I was appealing to their intelligence.
Were you, sir?  Can you prove one word of all your fancy story?
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Robbed.  He was angry.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to buy the seven acres from you?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is eight days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
Hard man to live with.
How would you know?
That's no bull.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided not not come forward.
But even after you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know nothing.  Claimed not to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed ignorance!
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the truth.
You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
How long you have this detail?
You mean, early morning the 16th?
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
You said three minutes.
Won't take two.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Have a look.  At nothing.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
No, you don't.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
Yes, he was.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
That's when he fell.
Fell.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And that makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
But you could be wrong.  He could have climbed up earlier.
The knife.  What knife?
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
He hit his head.  On the way in.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
Well, anything coulda caused that.
Cigarette?
I'll take two.  One for later.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  You're the story today.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
You always run with the well open?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
You gaff with the hook end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
White or black?
I think you like learning.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is first-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks believe is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Maybe.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Does it now?
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
It is.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat?
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
No spare.
No.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn?
I believe so.
You don't.  Think so.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
And her farmhouse...?
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
What else could it be?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
You said that.  That was your testimony.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Your report says death by drowning, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
Is it possible?
And that you can't say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death?
But you are certain that he died by drowning.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
Are you absol...
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
Carl ever say he got one?
You can speak for what he said. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
The question is more about the defendant's attitu...
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
I'm looking for a man.
A bowler.
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
The pin machine?
You have orange whips?
No. I'm from Akron.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
It belonged to my dad.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Heh, heh, heh.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
Sorry about your loss.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
It's splitsville for you.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Yeah, basement bingo.
Lemme see your ball.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Three whips. To go.
When you get a chance.
Hey, you still here?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
La da da dalala...
I hate fuckin' opera.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
You know, Elvis bowled.
No kiddin'.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
canker sore.
How do you turn this thing off?
Wait! That's an aria!
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
I'd buy it!
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
See ya 'round Faz.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
What's on your mind, Miles?
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
This scam we got going here was your
It's a beautiful thing.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Wish me luck.
Buzz Fazeli.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Need some advice, huh.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
They suspended me for 100 years.
100 years!
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
That game was before you was born.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
Where'd you get this ball?
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
She's my mom.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
I got a right. You're my father.
I ain't nobody's father!
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
Theo.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
Putt-putt golf?
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
The small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
What's it look like to you?
I do what I gotta do to survive.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
I'm your blood.
You wish!
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
Don't say that about my mom!
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
I'm getting to like it here.
I gotta survive.
No...
I didn't think so.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
I couldn't care less.
We ain't married no more.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
I am underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
What about bowling?
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
You're a scumbag.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Clam it!
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Hello, mom?
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
Don't tell me, John.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
How's that?
Uh...over easy.
I don't like to talk about it.
It depends.
Knock-knock.
Buzz Fazeli.
Who's there?
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
What did you do to Buzz?
I don't want to play.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Who's there?
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
It's not an Alley. I hate when people call it a Bowling Alley, it's so common! I prefer Bowling Center.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
No!
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
You know who I am?
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your big four, darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
What if he wants to get out?
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
What ever happened to just bowling?
I like the sport the way it is.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
How Mr. Kastle?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Where's Junior?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
Leave him alone!
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
Fantastic! What talent.
You still got the touch Junior.
Bowling Center!
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
They suspended me.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
He's my father, Millie.
Where can I find him?
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Uh...over easy.
Coming right up.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Mine, and they never tip.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
I came here to have a word with your dad.
What do you want with my dad?
Won't your father help you with that?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
This is a vicious cycle.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
Whoa.
It's a vicious cycle.
Mind if I cut in?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
No. Not at the present.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
So, what about you?
We'll get into that later.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
Why were you suspended?
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?
Plan B is your dad.
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
He said he'd sponsor me.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Nothing.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
Sheila, please.
What's plan C?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Really? I kinda like it.
Do you talk with your mom?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
What are you going to do about your brother?
You're here.
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
...lane six. Yes.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
Nothing.
Too late for what, Sheila?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
You got any broken bones?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
It's Junior, isn't it.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
He's my father.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
I'll be at the bridge.
You told Junior that we did it.
It?
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
We would have sooner or later.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
How do you get this thing down?
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
He's dead Sheila.
I feel sick.
Are you sure he's dead?
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
Where are you going?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Can I come with you?
Why did you come back?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
You're really pissing me off.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
What about plan C?
Fuck plan C!
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Sez you!
Suck my dick!
Very professional.
I am a professional man.
Can you change something this big?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
I'm not here to bowl.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Some unfinished business.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
You guys got something going on downstairs?
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Basement bingo?
Tell your little pal to let go.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Very good, busyboy.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Who identified the body?
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of New York Bowler from his pocket. The headline reads RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Please, Dr. Levine.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Fletcher, I want you back here.
Get out of there!
Fletcher!  Now!
How big is this spacecraft?
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
In basic English, what does all this mean?
There's heat coming the door.
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
Would you wait a minute?
Hold on --
What is it?
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
How about I just press the button?
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Norman!
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
How long will that be?
Two and a half days?
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Yeah.  I heard you.
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Nobody move.
But she's --
Nobody move!
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
Direction's east coming!
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
What if it attacks?
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
High Voltage?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Forty yards.
But you've tested it?
Thirty yards.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Where is it?
What was that?
He's right beneath us.
Increase positive pressure!
That's our reserve air.
It's either that or we grow gills.
Don't do it, Norman!
Do you see it?
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a fire we can't stop.  Norman?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Norman, don't do it!
Don't do it!
Now!
Norman, please!  Don't!
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
What have you been told so far?
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Anything else?
Nothing else.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
From what?  What's with all the security?
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
They didn't tell me anything.
How deep is he?
A thousand feet.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
What?
What do you need me for?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
-- Wait a second --
dating the crash at least that old.
Hold on --
Maybe older --
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
It's impossible.
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
What team?
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
What's wrong with oxygen?
It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
What is it, Norman?
Take a look.
Picked up something?  What is it?
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
Maybe we shouldn't.
What?
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
Like Thou shall not kill?
Or maybe, it can't be killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know.  That's the point.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
Just worry about yourself.
Harry's missing.
What do you mean, he's missing?
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
But sir --
No buts.  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
How drastic?
You don't want to know.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
She should've known better.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
When was this?
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
Wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line
He translated it wrong.  My name is Jerry?  It's like See Spot run.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What am I -- a dog, now?
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Edmunds?
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Edmunds?  Can you copy?
What for?
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Going active.
Jerry?
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
I see it.
Can you open that panel?
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
What caused it?
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
They're coming.
Any sign of Harry?
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
What the hell is going on here?
Well, where the fuck is he?
They've left, keep watching!
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
How much damage?
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
It's chipped.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
I did.
Ted?  Captain?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
What?
A break for what?
So how do we get it open?
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
The what?
So?  What's the problem?
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
You don't know that.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
Gimme a report, I want --
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Please watch your closest monitor...
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
What's the message?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
How do you mean, strange?
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
It's not ignorant.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
He understands me fine.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
She's not gonna know, sir.
What?
He's saying, Take me to your leader. He wants to know who's in charge.
With an o.  Harold with an o.
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
She's not gonna know.
She wired this system.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
A half a mile long?
Nobody goes inside, until we know what's inside.
I'd also like it noted --
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What about a crowbar?
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
Ted, get her away from the door.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
Look at this.
What is it?
Some sort of lead or something.
Radiation shield, you think?
A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
What's wrong?
What do you make of this?
We had considered it.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Did you hear me, sir, because --
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
Sir, about leaving --
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
They switched us over.
To what?
Internal power.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
From the sphere?
What's inside the sphere.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Edmunds?
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Too big?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Resetting the sub.
In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the delay button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
I love secrets.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Because when we get down there --
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Underwater?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
It never occurred to me.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
What -- are you threatening me?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
Good theory, Ted.
Norman!
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
The library.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
What do you mean -- not normal?
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Wait a minute.
What?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Yeah, why?
And you didn't tell anyone?
Beth --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Beth.
Beth --
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Beth.
What could have done this?
Norman.
What are they?
Eggs.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
So what?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN.
You went through Edmunds' things?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
What?
You told him about me?
Beth --
You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.
You bastard.
Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Beth --
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
I have to reset the sub.
Forget the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You, me and Harry?
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
Four days?
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
Why should I go?
I would.  But my suit --
I fixed your suit.
You don't trust me?
But I don't know how --
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
Still clear.
What's the matter?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Still clear?
Still clear.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
He what?
You get it straightened out?
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
The refridgerator.
That wasn't in there before.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
None of this was here before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
You think?
You don't believe me.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
What?
Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
Squids?
... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
Manifested?
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, Stop calling me Jerry.  And --
He translated it wrong.
What?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
But how?
I don't know.
How can the sphere do that?
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
But why is he doing it?
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Diphenyl parlene.
Something for burns.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
It's for motion sickness.
Valdomet.
Ulcers.
Sintag.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Bingo.
Riordan?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Parasolutrine?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's a soporific.
What's that?
Causes sleep.
It's like a sleeping pill?
... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride...
How long does it last?
Three to six hours.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
How fast does it take effect?
Doesn't say.
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
It's an idea.
Beth --
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
You want to kill him?
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
For what?
Not believing you.
What is it, Norman?
Where are you?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Your watch.
Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
What's wrong, Norman?
I'm feeling better.
Are you?
You think I'd really drink that?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
I did do that, didn't I?
How do you feel about snakes?
You know what I mean.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
You tell me.
Don't you?
Are you manifesting them?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Did you?
What's the phrase -- keeping up with the Joneses?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
No, he isn't.
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Someone did.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
C'mon -- what?
You're lying --
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
But --
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, Beth.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
You're insane.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Yes.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  Like everything's on the tip of my tongue, he said.
That's bullshit.
Is it?
Beth, the message said Harry.  My name is Harry.  My name isn't Harry.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  Mommy
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water. Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything. Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
But I have to, Norman.
I promise --
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Beth --
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's either this... or I kill you.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
It's not safe for you to be either.
You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Get away from the door, Beth.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Beth!
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Don't you know?
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Then where's it coming from?
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Beth?
Leave me alone, Norman.
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
I --
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
What is that?  What are you doing?
What?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Beth --
Get away --
Would it work?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
How's that?
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
No.  I don't think so.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Well, they're not mine.
It doesn't make any sense.
Well, what's your theory?
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
By the bunks.
He doesn't wait for an answer.
Who says it's a he?
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
For whoever's in that thing.
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
Then what is it?
It's an American spacecraft.
What are you looking for?
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
I never said that.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
In time for what?
What?
Just in time for what?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Yes you are...
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
We can refuse to talk.
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
When did it come across?
Where's it coming from?
Is it coming from our own computer?
What?
You holding up alright?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
I'm fine.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
No, why don't --
C'mon.
Wait a second, I --
C'mon, Norman.
Look, would you --
Nice work, Norman.
Whatever I can do to help.
Our answer.
To what?
This answers one of our questions.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... sphere.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
Our present.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Not a clue.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
I don't follow you.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an Unknown Entry Event. They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
So what?
So, we know.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  But they didn't.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
I can't believe that, Harry.
Gimme another explanation.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Am I?
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
No.  I didn't say that.
Then what, Norman?
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
What is that?  That noise?
It's like...
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
What are you still doing here?
You remember opening the door?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
Then explain it to me.
What is it, Harry?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
That far in what, Harry?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
What are they?
Getting anywhere with those?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Did I?
You don't remember that?
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
... you there?  Norman?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What happened to her?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Her suit's gone.
Beth left?
I thought she was with you.
She's cracking, Norman.
You didn't say that about the food?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
But why would she -- ?
She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
Wisconsin's your answer.
Wisconsin?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
How do we decode it?
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
The three of us.
That's right.
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
What is it?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
Did I kill her?
I don't think so.
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
Fine.
Help me lift her.
We're never gonna make it.
Shut up and open the door.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
How far away's the sub?
I can't reach her.
Hold on.
Push her, c'mon.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Missed.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
I heard!  I heard!
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
C'mon, Norman!
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Gimme a second --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Her legs are in the way.
You got her?
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
I'm trying.  There.
You know how to work this thing?
Well, press something!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
How's that working out, by the way?
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
There is one possibility.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
You mean forget?
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
What does Norman already know?
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
She told me what you said, Norman.
What is it, Harry?
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
English?
That's right.
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
But it's impossible.
Is it?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
Think about it.
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Meaning?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Please.  It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here.  It arrived here.
Arrived?  From where?
Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
Well, if it's a discharge --
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
Codes are for hiding information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
What'd you say?
We are friends.
Good idea, Ted.
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming witchcraft.  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
The ships?
How are the others?
Beth and Harry?
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
No, they didn't say --
Captain who?
What report?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
You've heard of me?
What report?
What report?
Know what?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
He's a pussy.
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Like what?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
You mean a picture?
I don't see anything.
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that someone went to a lot of trouble
Well, he's polite.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
When he uses a phrase like I am Happy, I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
Why's that?
What was it?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Not that I know of.  Why?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
I'm not sure.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Four.  Four years --
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
I don't know.
How you doing, man?
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
What an honor...
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
You rich kids... are all the same !
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Well, maybe you better look again.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
It's what I deserve.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
Naw, right here's okay.
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
No, this hurts.
YAAAAAAAA !
Mobile Infantery rules !
Death to all bugs !
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
I didn't see him !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
What about it, Diz ?
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Not enough, I guess.
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
We're the old men, Ace.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir, no, sir.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Others are waiting.
Did you read her mind ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
You got it bad.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Ace of spades.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
In addition to psychic dolt this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
How do you make him do that ?
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Your father will never let you.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I don't believe it !
I got Games & Theory.
Please continue, Sergeant.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Are you alright ?
I'm getting better.
So what are you doing later ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
I'm all ears.
Johnny, this is Zander.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
Only when I give you an order.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Or...?
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Profile's wrong... there.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Well, whad'ya know...
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
You and me, huh ?
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
WHERE IS IT ?
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
It looks like an... asteroid.
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Johnny, wait...
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
Zander, please... Let's go !
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
So ?
So who's got time to get married ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Carmen...?
Excuse me...!
I'm sorry, Carmen.
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
You're upset, that's alright.
Where are you going ?
A funeral.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Yeah.
I don't know, Zander.
I do.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Zander, what are you doing ?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Zander, no...!
Your turn...
She's flying starships !
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
I have good reflexes.
Eeuch !
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Excuse me...!
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
I don't want everyone to see.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
It's all I think about anymore.
You can't walk me home.
Why not ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Carl can wait.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
I'll meet you outside.
None at all... We won.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
You two have so much in common.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Are you the boy for me ?
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Who cares ?
I love you, Carmen.
Shhh...
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
You're late.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
You talk to Carl ?
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
Alright, I love you.
Do you mean it ?
Shhhh...!
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
What happened to your hair ?
It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Should I be ?
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
That was just a mix up.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
How are you, Carl ?
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
See you on the bounce !
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
We've gotta go get her !
Which way ?
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am !
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
No way, ma'am !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Hut... hut !
What ?
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
How come we never got together ?
Sure.
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
You're the best.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
No thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Flip six, three hole.
What ?
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
You got it.
It stinks, you goin.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
Well, see ya.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
What's that, Diz ?
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
C'mon...
You used to dance...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Hey, Diz...
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Diz, see what you can do.
I'm on it !
What frequency ?
All bands.
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Mr. Rasczak.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
I won't quit !
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
I wouldn't mind.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Sir, yes, sir !
Here in Buenos Aires.
No, sir.
Courage, I guess.
Aw, don't get mushy.
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
Well, yeah, sure...
Hi, mom.
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
You can never be sure.
Best in the Fleet !
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
The Rodger Young just burned up...
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
What do you think you're doing ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Yeah, that's right.
Move out.
Can you walk ?
Not a problem.
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
How bad are you, pal ?
Been better, buddy.
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Don't be a hero...
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Uh, I don't know.
Mister Rasczak ?
What is it, Rico ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Good for you. Go find out.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
All dead except one, sir.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Yes, sir...
Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
Yes, sir !
Who's that with you ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Yes, sir.
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
What's going on, Diz ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Yes, sir !
Hit your jets, sir !
I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
How about some ammo?
How much?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Try and take it.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.
What're you laughing about?
Napoleon... small.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...We're saved!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
They are robots!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She dropped in on me... holding this.
Who are you?
I brought the girl remember?
The girl?
He's a she!
You noticed...
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
So you do know her.
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
It means, Never without my permission.
That's what I thought.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Those lying motherfuckers!
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
Do you have bandages?
Now listen to me very carefully.
No one must follow your work.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
No way!
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Liquid metal.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Can I stop by my house?
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
You sure?
I would.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Max.
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Anything it samples by physical contact.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
You told me to.
You have to do what I say?!
That is one of my mission parameters.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Why?
Why?
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Right.
Swear.
What?
Everything.
Cool.
Does it hurt?
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Affirmative.
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say eat me... if you wanna shine them on, it's Hasta la vista
Hasta la vista, baby?
Yeah, or later
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
No problemo.
Smile?
Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Not even of dying?
No.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
You will.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
Why do you cry?
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Pain causes it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
No.
Alriight!!  My man!
No problemo.
No fate.  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.
She intends to change the future somehow.
Dyson.
Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!
This is tactically dangerous.
Drive faster.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
I'll deal with the police.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Trust me.
Drive for a minute.
We don't have much time.
What?
Is it dead?
Terminated.
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Of course.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Will it melt in there?
Yes.  Throw it in.
No!
I'm sorry, John.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
I have to go away, John.
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
It must end here... or I am the future.
I order you not to!
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Easy money!
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
Out of the way, John!
No!  Don't kill him!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
We're better off by ourselves.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Mom?  You okay?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Uh huh.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I love you, John.  I always have.
I know, Mom.  I know.
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
I got it.  Piece of cake.
Go!  I'll finish here.
Ready to rock?
Ready.
John, get out of the way!!
SHOOT!!!!
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
They took him from me.
I know!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
Kyle, don't go!
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Can it be destroyed?
Unknown.
You look like handmade shit.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to read-only when we are sent out alone.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
No.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Why him?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Then what?
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
And Skynet fights back.
Why attack Russia?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
I have detailed files.
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
The CPU from the first terminator.
Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
It's finally over.
No.  There is another chip.
Are you afraid?
What are you doing?
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Yes, Chuck?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
Alright!
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
I won't let the fat kid down.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
What do you think?
You're a big help.
I hate the beige one.
I thought you did.
You must have a girlfriend.
Aha!  Is she young?
Do you understand?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
And you're from the future too?
Right.
Just let me go.
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
There's so much...
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
everythingis gone.  just gone.  there were survivors. here.  there.  Nobody knew who started it.  it was the machines.
I don't understand...
Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
The what?
Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
You cold?
Freezing.
Come here.
Reese...you got a first name?
Kyle.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
It's okay.  Forget it.
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
What?
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
What's he like?
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
I volunteered.
You volunteered?
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
I'm sure.
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah...this is the message... 'Sarah
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?
About where you're from.
Bag some Z's?
That's where we're going.
Why?
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
What about it?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Molecular-memory.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
That's the way it was told to me.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
That's not my mission.
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Kyle?
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Is this enough?
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
What's that?
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
You must have had a fun child-
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Hot dogs?
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
My whole life has been combat.
I want it to be over for you.
Not possible.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Don't say that.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
No.  I'm not.
Good fighters.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Someone?
A girl.  You know.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.
Oh, Kyle.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
Kyle...
I bet you're ticklish.
What are you doing?
I don't think I like this.
You're not supposed to.
Sarah.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
What are you doing?
Cover...our footsteps...
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Who is in authority here?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
I can't sleep.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
Admittedly...
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
What?
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not stepping down.  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, without Daniel Grant
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
Did you play recently?
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
I apologized, I offered to help.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I said I was sorry...
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Oh, no... you.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
What are you babbling about, psycho?
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
What's with him?
Do you know what to do?
Oh, God... !
Don't just stand there, get help!
This can't be real...
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
Alright... okay...
He's turning blue!
This is nuts.
What is your problem?
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
A game?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and wet himself... ?
I'm sorry, about this...
You should be.
There's got to be a flashlight.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
See you around.
Where are you going?
Home.
How do you know that's the way?
It was a gift... from my brother.
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
Never mind.
Don't even think about it.
Read what it says: Warning
If there was one.
... wait for help.  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
I'll give you a boost.
You first.
You pull me up.
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
No.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
Oh.  FIne.
I'll wait.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
This is C.R.S.
What's C.R.S.?
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
They'll love that.
Yes... well...
You deserted me.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Never did catch your name.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
That's classic.
Why... ?
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
Where are we going?
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
What exactly do you do?
Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
Nice.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
A fresh shirt...
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Goodnight.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Keep it.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
It's okay, dad.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Come here...
What is it?
Is this you?
Where'd you get this?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Well... the red bra.
Okay.
I thought...
Do you mind if I sit?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Want anything to drink?
You?
Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
Take the picture out.
What's wrong?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
They're watching.
Wha... ?
Not here!  They can see.
No!  I'm sick of this...
Nicholas...
What is this!?
What are you doing... ?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
Who are they?
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Then, what good are you?
That's a lie...
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, before you started the game.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
They did the same to him as they did to you.
What are you talking about... ?
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
What did you say?
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
Who the fuck cares?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Scams, con games.  How many?
I don't know.  A lot.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
Who is it?
What do we do?
Who is it?
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What... what do you mean?
It's out of your hands.
What are you doing here?
I'm back from the dead.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Get us out of here...
Nicholas...
Get us out!
What do you think you're doing?
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
How deluded can you be?  There's no why...
Who's responsible?!
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
They won't...
Where'd you get that... ?
... what... ?
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
What the fuck are you... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...
We searched the house.
Guess you missed it.
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a real gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
What are you doing?
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Fuck you.
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
I saw them kill him!
What did you really see?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Stop talking to them!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Nicholas...
Shut up!
Let me show you...
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
That's not true...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
No...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Stop it!
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
Don't move, you bitch... !
I have to show you...
No!
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
I didn't know what else to call you.
Claire.
Claire.  Pleased to meet you.
I have to get to the airport...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Like... where are you from?
Originally, Connecticut.
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Boyfriend?
No.
Underwear?
Always.
Hey there, Nickie.
Happy Birthday, man.
Seymour Butts.  I never get tired of that one.
That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
They'll be wanting it back.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Which grad-school?
You look good.
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
About me?
Never better.
Elizabeth?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
I redecorated.  What about you?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
You need anything?
No.
Really?
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
You shouldn't have.
Call that number.
Consumer Recrreation Services. What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me.  Call that number.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
Fun?
Like a stroke?
Call them.  Trust me.
Tell me you'll call.
Okay.
Will you?
I said I would...
But, will you?
Are you still on mediction?
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
I'll call them, okay?
It doesn't matter...
I'm going to call.
Do it for YOU.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
I know...
Tell me where we're going.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
What are you doing?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
Who?
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the real fucking begins.
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
What have they been doing to you?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's them.  They did this.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
How do you know?
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Okay... okay.
The phone's dead.
Really?
Do you know how to change a tire?
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
How did those... ?
You're part of it...
What?  Connie...
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Stop this.  It's not true...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
Stop it!
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
What?
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Really?
Split it?
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Did she?
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
Yes.
I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
Yes.
Yes, very lucky.
I need your car, Elizabeth.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
I'll explain someday.
I'll call.  I really will.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
Oh, here we go...
What is?
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
No, thank you.
You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Oh... it's a game.
A game?
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
And if nothing's lacking?
May I make two suggestions... ?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
How long will these take?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your crack team.
It's all down to this...
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
You mean, dissatisfied.
Get rid of them.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
You don't need me...
Where?
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Guess!
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I can't tell you how not interested I am.
Don't take another step.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Have we met?
The key?
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
You did?  How is he?
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Is everything alright?
Fine.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Goodnight then.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
What makes you ask?
I'm not sure.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Did you worry about him?
Nobody worried about your father.
Goodnight.  See you home.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
What's this about?
Look, where is he?!
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
No.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
I know who she is.  Take a message.
I don't like her.
What gentleman, Maria?
Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
Why are you following me?
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
I wasn't expecting you.
Don't ask.
Follow me.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
It was a misunderstanding.
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Just what I told you.
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
Sam...  Thank you.
He hasn't called back.
Attempted murder.
You warm my heart.
Uh... Nell Vance...
Well, I... uh...
I only saw Theo drive up.
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Yeah.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
I've read your tests.
And those are Luke's and mine.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
You get your money.
It's a question.
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
And why didn't Marrow tell us? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
Luke.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
You could have.
No.
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Yeah.
Maybe someday.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Nell --
Was sure she'd be in here.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
No.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
All the carvings.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
Sorry.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
Nell!  What's wrong?
That smell... oh, God.
It was very specific.
All right...
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
And then what happened?
Hmm.
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
Are you coming to confess?
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
I don't know.
What is that tune?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
That's what I'm saying.
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed hundreds.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
Nell.  You will come here now.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Then who called me?
No.
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
Come on.
No --
What'll happen to us, Nell?
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
What?
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
That?  That's Hill House.
There were no children.  Rene died, and then Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Have either of you seen David Watts?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
When do we take the tests?
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Mary came with me.
Get a blanket!
It's okay... we're all here...
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
How could you do this to people?
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Oh God, we can't get out!
Nell, what do we do?
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
But the experiment was a failure.
Oh!  You scared me.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Why do you need a chain like that?
Is there something about the house?
Who?
Why?
Yes.
Why?
Mrs. Dudley.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
Why would we --
No one will come any nearer than that.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
Fifteen dollars.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
It's all I could afford.
I don't know what you mean.
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
That's why we're here.
What do you do?
That depends.
Not really.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
No.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
Jeez.
I know.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
You're okay.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Yes.  I've missed it.
Good night, Theo.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
How could he have left without his keys?
Watts?
What's his first name?
David.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
David?
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
No, it's getting worse.
Theo... Did you?
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
That's so sad.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I've never had a pedicure before.
Well?
Red.  What else?
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I have a loft.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
I don't know, you know...
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Are you sure?
I think so.
Okay.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he says --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
What do you think?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Nell, what happened?
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
I don't think I want any.
I do.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
Just had to be sure.
Then let's go get you one.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I want to know why you need that scary guy in your house.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Then what good is he?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Is that a problem?
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm not.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
Like you.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. The sensual experience.
Oh, god.
Italian?
I'm sorry.
Italian.
Who?
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
Sure.
I like the colors.
We all did.
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
I'm a gracious host.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
What's the matter?
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
I sure hope so.
We think someone is here.
No.
Because --
Hey.
Not bad.
Okay.
Where do we go?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
This is un-fucking professional.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
What.
What kind?
Our black friends?
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Where do you think he is, Mike.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
Let him break - he likes to break.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Been to the Boat Show.
Yeah?
Lookin' good.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
CQ what?
Edward Rama?
Eduardo.  Rama.
I didn't expect anyone.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Round about, yeah.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
It was better than a telegram.
Who done it, then?
Huh?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Terry Valentine.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
What more is there.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
Boomerang.
Y'what?
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
This ain't your lot?
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
I only asked.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
Did Jenny know?
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing them.  Checking them out.  I felt like she was covering my ass that day.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
She didn't write to me, did she.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
You're kiddin' me, right?
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
And that's where you met Jenny.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Huh?
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Has he?
That was one of them?
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
What's so fucking funny?
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Valets.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
First in, first out, that's me.
What are we standing on?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
You goin' back inside?
One thing I need.
Steady on.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Too easy?
He's gotta know why.
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
I've been wondering something.
Again?
Do you have any friends, man?
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
What post office?
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Not much -- you?
Uh-huh.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Probably.
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Really.
Didn't get it.
Well, those are the breaks.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
You just cooking then?
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
No, but I know what he means.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Hard to miss.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Had a feeling it was you.
You look alike.
Not her brand.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
Why did you come here?
No, why did you come here?
Sort a few things out.
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
That's not what I heard.
What was that, then?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- at Her Majesty's pleasure.
It was the bars, then.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Try calling me again.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Now who's being sarcastic?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
Not embarrassed.
Ashamed.
Disappointed.
She never told Eddie, though.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
I might've been away for the weekend.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
He give me your address.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Nah, accommodation address.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Something like that, yeah.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What line is he in.
I see.
I bet.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
Why not.
Are you serious.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
What do you think.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
Depends, don' it.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
There's the phone.  You want his number.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming straight to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
You don't seem bothered.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Tell us about it.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
I can see the attraction.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
We were lucky to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Hey?
From pursuing your chosen profession.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Who remembers.
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight.  What about just now?
You have been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
I don't believe it.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
You ever been to London?
Only in the movies.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where hurricanes hardly ever happen.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
What about your grandmother?
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
He alive to see this?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
What'd your father do?
Black market during the war.
I guess you're just habitual.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  If you're naughty
I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it wasn't a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
Where's Big Sur?
Up the coast.
How far?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Fancy it?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Bloke told me.
Friends and colleagues.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Poor baby.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been me for the high jump.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Eh?
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
All of what?
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
And that is?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Yeah?
No kidding.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
Yeah, that's right.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Been away a lot.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Could do, yeah.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
How much.
Five thousand.
Hey.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
Which kind?
The forever kind.
Good luck.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I really want to fuck you.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
I don't know.
The L.A.P.D.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
That don't mean nothin'.
She's nice lookin'.
So what.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Lemme break.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Something's on.
You do?
You bet.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs plausible denial.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
He ain't wrong.  Listen, I know this asshole who did just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  That's the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't get it.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. Avery wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
What's in it?
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
I doubt it.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
Hello there.
Exercising my visitation rights.
I miss my kids.
You've made it ... brighter.
Sure you do.
No trouble.
Susan.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Is he here?
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Go now.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Pleasure.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Ah.
I don't.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
Thanks.  You, too.
Be seein' you.
What.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the deal.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
Why then.  Why did you do it!
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
It better be good.
No.
Great.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
What doors?
You said the system couldn't fail!
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
What's left of it.
We need light in here, stat.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
So the method of death is the only connection?
You're kidding.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than the dog ate my homework.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
Oh.
What happened to them?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
How big is the sub-basement?
I think I should come with you.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
The sub-basement?
I smell it.  It's here.
Everybody.  Get behind me.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
May I see that?
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
Got my hands full here.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
I know.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
Not so loud.
All right everybody, hold up!
What does it say?
What's that doing here?
I'd say we're in its home.
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
I don't believe it.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I'm not giving up.
You must.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Let me see the plant press.
What is it?
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
You're right.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
What are they?
They're eggs.
Like the claw.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  He Who Walks on All Fours.
Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm... poor eyesight.  External mucoid nasal glands
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
What's going on?
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
I think so.
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
Don't stop now.
What's that?
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Come back and get me.
We will.
Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
Dr. Frock?
Look who's here, Margo.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast.
Yes.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Yes, I do.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
But at what a price.
What?
That's impossible.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Mbwun.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
It's reptilian.
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
Okay.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
I don't understand.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
How did you know that?
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a monster species.  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
You were behind me?  Running after me?
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
Behind me.  Over there.
That's not what I saw.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
Wounded?
That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
The planetarium!
Is there another way around?
What is it doing?
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
I think... it means it's full.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
Help someone!
You smell that?
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
I can't!
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Do you live around here?
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
I think you better tell us.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Yup.
Does what?
Sorry. Don't have one.
What am I doing here?
Penetration but not perforation.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
They took her --
I need your clothes, Byers.
Yes.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Yes. I know.
Nothing completely conclusive --
Agent Mulder.
What is it you find incredible?
No, they don't.
Yes.
Into what?
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Do they know?
Who?
No. Don't bother.
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Have you examined them?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
How's that?
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
You follow me out here for a reason?
Yeah, I did.
I know the name. Why?
Old friend of your father's.
How'd you find me?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
You a reporter?
Who sent you?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
He just let it explode.
Those people were already dead.
Before the bomb went off?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
And one little boy.
I think you're full of shit.
Do you?
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
Not according to the men in blue.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
You know my work?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
How?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What was it?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What killed those men?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
I'll know soon enough.
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
A plague?
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
Negotiating with whom?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
You can't.
You found something?
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
What?
I'm not sure. A virus --
you saw this experiment?
What did it look like?
What do you think?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
That would be my guess.
You told me you had answers.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
Mulder -- it's me --
Where are you, Scully?
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
What's wrong, Scully?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
You're looking for a bomb.
I think they have that covered.
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
Mulder...?
What happened to playing a hunch?
Jesus, Mulder...
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
How's that?
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
Now what?
It's locked?
Had you.
No you didn't.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
I just did. You're buying.
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Something sweet.
Scully...
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
I'm in the vending room.
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Nice try, Mulder.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
Something's not right...
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
All I told them was the truth.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
They were the ones that put us together.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
You're... quitting?
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
I wake you?
No.
Why not? It's three AM.
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Is that what you'd like me to do?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
According to this tag.
And you're looking for?
It's like jelly.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Why are you whispering?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
You said you weren't coming?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
What did you find?
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
How was it contracted?
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
He didn't mention a park.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
And you've never seen anything like that?
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
This looks like new grass to you?
It looks pretty green for this climate.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
All the equipment is brand new.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
I don't know, Mulder.
And where are they going with it?
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
What are my choices?
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Where would they be going?
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
I don't know why I think they went right.
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
-- of what exactly?!
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
Yeah, well they may this one.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
This virus -- it...
Mulder --
It may be extraterrestrial.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Been where?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
What do you think it is?
I have no idea.
This is weird, Mulder.
Very weird.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
For the purpose of what?
You hear that?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Scully....?
Yeah...?
Run.
What are you doing?
Come on!
I don't know.
What? What's wrong?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
I have. I did. It's done.
Just like that --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
I need you on this, Scully --
You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
What? What happened?
I think... something stung me.
Scully...
Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
No -- it's --
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Cold...
Where are we?
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
I can't go any farther.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
We're going to the morgue.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Well, call General McAddie.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
Thank you.
She was with me.
And they want to blame us?
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Are we being watched?
I've got to find Scully.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
He's come and gone.
Where's Scully?
I have answers for you.
Is she alive?
Yes.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
About the conspiracy?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
I want to know where Scully is.
What is it?
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
A virus?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
Why are you telling me this?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
Let me out. Stop the car.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
How?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
What alien environment?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
My life is over.  Go.
More concerns than that?
My god...
This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Did we go sailing?
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
He hates me.
Lucien Baines?
She adores you.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
I don't want to find out.
Shush.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
I do it all the time!
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
I'd be there for him.
Okay, okay...
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
No.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Don't bring it home in this.
Okay.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
That's my girl.
Sing a song of sixpence.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
Why did we stop?
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
He needs to be turned over.
I'll be fine.
She said convincingly.
No.  No.
Is it cold in here?
What happened?
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Damn him.
What's wrong?
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I know.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was normal?  Conscious.  How far would you go?
As far as I needed.
There's always a chance they'll confess.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some troubled kid you're dealing with.
I realize that...
How hard could it be...?
I know him.
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
It doesn't have much to do with science.
What then?
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
Peter, okay?
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
That's what therapists are for, right?
With Stargher I saw things...
What did you see?
Why'd you bring him here?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
I did, yeah.
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
You think you can do this, don't you?
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like remorse.
Then what is he?
Evil.
If you believe that.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What happened to Charles Gish?
What happened?
What difference does it make...?
Tell me.
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
You're sure of that?
Yes.  I am.
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
Okay, okay...
Wait...
Like hell wait.
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
I can't leave him!
That went well.
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Yep.  Eloped.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
So you say.
He's mine?
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
It doesn't matter...
I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
I got it.
Thank you.
No problem.
No.  Thank you.
What are we going to do?
He's beautiful...
What now?
Who says?
Oh no... No you don't.
I bet we can fix it.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
That hoist, with the winch...
Delano?
You're kidding me.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as receivers.  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
Intravenous administration complete.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
What's wrong?
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
When did he lapse into the coma?
Sometime yesterday morning.
What about the legalities of this...?
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
Catherine!
I'll get her...
Yes.
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
No.
Absolutely.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
What about narcotics?
No.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Is she alright?
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Agent Novak.
Dr. Kent.
You're looking well.
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
That's a secret.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
How's the patient.
What about the cat?
Completely unaware.
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
It's his dog.
Here he is.
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
We proceed assuming she is.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
I don't have to.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say It was all his idea.
Right here.
But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Ja, ja, ja.
They think you did it.
Thank you.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Do you understand German?
No, no...oh...excuse me.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
He has a little dog.
Oh, yes, yes.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
His own doctor?
Were you at the inquest?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
He was Harry's driver?
Mmmm.
...at all.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
What's she talking about?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
They're forged.
Why?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Dr. Winkel.
Drink?
Whiskey.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Who are you looking for now?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Silly looking bunch.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Need we go through it all again?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Can I hear you?
In German?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Well you read this.
What's that?
Ein hurigan - I guess.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Tell me about him.
Tell you what?
When...what did you do?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
...to steal my girl.
Where is she?
Oh, that was many years ago.
Tell me more.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
Seemed like a good idea.
It's just what he used to say.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Holly.
It's all right.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Yes.
Let's go away.
What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Wait here.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
What are you going to do?
I wish I knew.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
I don't know.
I'm going back home.
Why?
What happened to your hand?
A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
Have you?
He told you, didn't he?
He liked to laugh.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
I'll put these flowers in water.
...again.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
Are you going, too?
Oh...
...is there?
I'm sorry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
I shall be all right.
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
I saw him today.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
...quarrel?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Thank you.
Nichts danke. Kein.
...parents.
Yes.
It's a miracle!!!
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They're Harry's.
That's the reason.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
There's nothing in them.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
And my passport?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
We loved each other, do you mean that?
Do you know this man?
I have never seen him.
Joseph Harbin...
He works in a military hospital.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
It wasn't important.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Two weeks ago.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
Where's Harry?
That's what we want to find out.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
I don't know.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Must you take those?
They are - private - letters.
I don't want it.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Good-bye.
Yes.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Where?
How will I know you?
What is it?
No, not yet.
Yes, of course.
Fellow called Lime.
My name is Calloway.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
No.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Schmolka!
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
When did you see him last?
September '39.
Once in a while.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Holly Martins.
No, sorry.
Did you ever hear of The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?
I can't say that I have.
No.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
What?
Him dying like that.
Best thing that ever happened...
What are you trying to say?
He was...
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Pin it on a...
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
It wasn't petrol.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
What the devil?
Getting around, Martins.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Calloway.
Miss Schmidt.
You're not locking her up?
Get the next plane.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
A bruised lip.
A parrot bit me.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
Well?
In Vienna...
Do you see what that means?
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Next, Paine.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
So would I.
Bring him in.
I can't. He disappeared...
...a week ago.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
I'm not asking you to.
...in the morning.
Thank you. Excuse me.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Well?...
I suppose you don't believe me.
No.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
Which side of the road?
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
How about the doorway?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
It wouldn't work.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
Calloway!
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
A girl of spirit.
She's right. It's none of my business.
Didn't I?
You all did.
Of course.
Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
Paine lent me one of your books; Oklahoma Kid
All right, Calloway. You win.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
I said you win.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Wait a minute - let me out.
Be sensible, Martins.
Take him to Sacher's.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
...of Santa Fe."
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
No, I don't know...
...his number.
You do!
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did Hamlet and the week before we had something...
Welcome?
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
They wouldn't know me.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Come upstairs a moment.
I know a very good dentist.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
No, a major, were you really?
Heard of Harry Lime?
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Is that what you say to people after death? Goodness that's awkward...
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Certainly.
Seems exciting.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
What about?
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
What's that?
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Of course, of course, of course.
Zane Grey.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
What is it, Sergeant?
Who?
Never heard of him.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Hello, Harry.
Listen...
I want to talk to you.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
Hmm.
She's been arrested.
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
You can help her.
Holly...
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
I told the police.
Unwise, Holly...
And - Anna...
Did the police believe you?
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
You wouldn't do anything.
You can get somebody else...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Why not?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You've got plenty of contacts.
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
You told them, didn't you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Sure...
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
...this way.
What do you want?
Coffee.
You really liked it?
Here?
But he said he died instantaneously.
...you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Will you give me...
...your address?
What's the name of this girl?
Not yet.
How do you do.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Dr. Winkel?
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Martins.
Hear the details.
In great pain?
Speak English?
English?
Already gone.
Coffin?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Baron Kurtz.
Must be some mistake.
Yes, sir.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Yes, yes, I remember you.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
What's he saying?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
You saw it?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
I was told that he did not die at once.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
...give evidence.
Who else?
Kurtz.
Yes.
The Roumanian?
Yes.
And?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
You don't mean that doctor?
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Suppose I take...
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Now, hold on.
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Well make it your business.
Yes, it is.
Oh, you did.
Harry...
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Something wrong.
That's all you meant?
He didn't want to get involved.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
Joseph Harbin.
Third Man.
Not when I get interested.
Yes.
Should I make it all fact?
Never.
Oh.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Richard. Hi.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Help you out?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Just five dollars, please.
I'll share something with you.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Here.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Thanks.
Traveler.
I don't think so.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Bonjour.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Nice work.
That's the wrong one.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
We're going to swim one or two kilometers across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
I don't know - I'm American.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
Everyone ok?
I think we're about half way.
What!
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
A bit fucking late.
What happened?
Fuck off.
Eh - bonsoir.
Not too bad.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
So from there to there?
Swim?
No.
I think so too.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Exactly.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we donÃ†t try then we'll never know.
Where did you lose it?
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
So?
Uh-huh.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Yes. Of course..
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
It don't look like a leopard to me.
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
I drink.
And when you drink, you get drunk.
Then what do you do?
I sleep it off.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
I don't know.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
You really think so, Charlie?
They don't say it to me.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Let's get in your truck.
Where's that man?
Up at the museum.
Sure!
No. I'm serious about this.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
I'm sick.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
You found the leopard!
What's left of him.
Where? Where did you find it?
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head Ã¹- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone Ã¹Ã¹
What arroyo -Ã¹ how did you get to it Ã¹Ã¹
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
That's the place: I remember -Ã¹ My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click Ã¹ click Ã¹ click.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -Ã¹ He'll come up with something.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches Ã¹Ã¹
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it fits just perfect.
Hey Ã¹Ã¹ I'm over here.
Good evening.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths Ã¹Ã¹ that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in Zaza. After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
Well, I'd best be off.
It's about the leopard.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
That's right, of course.
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Yes?
It doesn't jibe with this Ã¹Ã¹ you told me the leopard would go out into the country Ã¹- it wouldn't stay in the city Ã¹Ã¹
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
You know Charlie How-Come?
We're old friends.
Come to look around?
More or less.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
About Charlie's leopard?
Yes.
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
Charlie likes his leopard.
It could be a man.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
Some crazy guy.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -Ã¹ eh?
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
Some other time.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
Just barely possible - - yes.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
To the eye? Like other men.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard Ã¹Ã¹  Don't you?
It was you.
Not! I tell you. No!
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
It's better you don't know.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
Tormented -- ? Why?
I couldn't rest Ã¹- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Then you found the leopard --
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith Ã¹ teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter Ã¹whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
That was unfortunate.
That was a calamity!
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Thanks.
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone Ã¹Ã¹
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
I thought they came right past here Ã¹Ã¹
They do, but -- there are no lights out there Ã¹- they'll just be shadows -Ã¹
Wait Ã¹Ã¹
No Ã¹- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -Ã¹ turn off the lights Ã¹Ã¹
Thanks, Sheriff.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
No. He was kidding Charlie.
State hunters?
Yes. The lipstick.
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
I'm sure of it!
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so Ã¹Ã¹
That's a fact, isn't it?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
That's easy. Me.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight Ã¹Ã¹walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No Ã¹- not yet.
And I never will- you know what's between us Ã¹ we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Get it out of here!
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
That's easy. Me.
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
And I never will -- you know what's between us -Ã¹ we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Clo-Clo?
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Are you all right?
Now look what you've done.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks Ã¹ for the funeral expenses.
Don't be soft.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
I don't know Ã¹Ã¹ a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
What did he have to do -Ã¹ look at the body?
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softÃ¹soap twenty editors!
Yeah.
And did you find the leopard?
It must be the altitude Ã¹Ã¹ you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootÃ¹andÃ¹saddle boys --
The whole town's in a state, Kiki Ã¹Ã¹doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep Ã¹Ã¹nobody on the streets at night Ã¹Ã¹
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Who is he?
Ã¹Ã¹	As long as my feet held out.
I can use them.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Yes.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me Ã¹Ã¹
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Yes. Do you mind?
And she waited here for him?
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
That doesn't make sense.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
You. Us.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Absolutely sure.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
What! You can't be --
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways Ã¹
How do you know?
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
We will Ã¹Ã¹
Kiki?
We stood here once before.
I know -- Teresa -Ã¹
I hated you that day Ã¹- you and your flip talk -Ã¹ with that little girl lying dead.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -Ã¹ where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
It's a lovely town Ã¹- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... WhyÃ†s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess thereÃ†s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says Ã¦closed to the publicÃ†, doesnÃ†t it?
ThatÃ†s right.
That might depend on where youÃ†re going.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
When will they be back?
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistressÃ†s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
No. Thank you. IÃ†ll be fine...
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brotherÃ†s death.
Now you know why youÃ†re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
That depends what youÃ†re looking at.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnÃ†t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over Ãº1,000 to get rid of him.
And that is the last time any...
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. WouldnÃ†t want anyone to interfere with his Ã¦ArtÃ†!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Perhaps it wasnÃ†t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The Ãº1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
I wonÃ†t comment on the time but youÃ†ll understand if I donÃ†t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.
IÃ†m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brotherÃ†s in trouble.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I donÃ†t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Oh-oh! TouchÃš, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. DonÃ†t. You might get confused speaking of things you donÃ†t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youÃ†ve done what we are paying you for.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Can it be that easy?
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Anything is possible.
ItÃ†s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. IÃ†m told it retails at around Ãº4,000.  I see you donÃ†t require a definition.
You seem surprised. Could it be you donÃ†t think that badly of him after all?  You neednÃ†t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
What... What are you talking about?
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Oh no. YouÃ†ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brotherÃ†s not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than heÃ†d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
How dare you...  You donÃ†t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
No. The question now is how long itÃ†s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Excuse me?
Get out of my house. YouÃ†re fired, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when youÃ†re...
No. YouÃ†re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Laurence!
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You lost my money?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
IÃ†m impressed. That information could have cost me Ãº20,000.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight IÃ†m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
Are we understood?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
You do want me to keep the job, donÃ†t you, Mrs De Moraes?
Mr Lombard?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Are you all right?
Yes... You woke me up... ItÃ†s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. IÃ†ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Paul Lamont...?
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
Mr Lombard...
IÃ†m really sorry you were not called...
YouÃ†re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
I... Well, weÃ†re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but itÃ†s late and with the funeral...
ArenÃ†t you curious to know about Friedman?
I... If you donÃ†t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. ThereÃ†s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
Black suits you.
WhatÃ†s in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
YouÃ†re mad...
Why... I donÃ†t know what youÃ†re talking about.
You know heÃ†d have had him killed, donÃ†t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Have you finished?
When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womanÃ†s intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
I guess the news youÃ†d sent me after Friedman didnÃ†t go down too well, eh?
Whatever the reason, IÃ†m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
You knew he had nothing to do with your brotherÃ†s disappearance, didnÃ†t you?
Huh! DonÃ†t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
How... When did you...
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. WhatÃ†s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
No!
What do you mean, Ã¦NoÃ†, Mrs De Moraes?
My brother hung himself.
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself...
Leon didnÃ†t hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnÃ†t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
...You-you spoke to him?
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
Your brother stumbled upon AdonisÃ†s little secret, didnÃ†t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnÃ†t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kidÃ†s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnÃ†t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Ã´Leon does his own prints. WouldnÃ†t want anyone to interfere with his Ã¦ArtÃ†Ã¶.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps itÃ†s the way you say them...
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why donÃ†t you accuse me of killing my brother?
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. YouÃ†d have been ready for me when I turned up with Ã¦Sleeping BeautyÃ†. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Ã´Not Leon,Ã¶ you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnÃ†t say Ã¦My God!Ã†, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Ã´Not Leon.Ã¶ Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman IÃ†d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at Ãº15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnÃ†t you?
Leon could still have hung himself.
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. HeÃ†d never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
YouÃ†re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought heÃ†d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I donÃ†t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnÃ†t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
You donÃ†t say.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
I didnÃ†t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? IÃ†ve known for five years. HeÃ†s known IÃ†ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnÃ†t speak about...
Think what you like. But donÃ†t presume to understand.
I donÃ†t.
Good.
Is there anything to understand?
Why do I feel I neednÃ†t answer that?
Five years of it. Surely, youÃ†d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
You splendid bastard...
...WeÃ†re turning in circles.
And you still havenÃ†t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Something like that?
Something like that.
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
DonÃ†t you believe in simplicity?
Should I?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But itÃ†s never that complicated really.
You seem to know what youÃ†re talking about.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
My husband didnÃ†t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
To get me killed...?
I didnÃ†t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youÃ†d been back.  That weÃ†d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnÃ†t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. ThatÃ†s when he hit me, and told me heÃ†d killed my brother... Ã´You donÃ†t know what youÃ†ve done,Ã¶ he said.  Ã´WeÃ†re in deep trouble,Ã¶ he said. Ã´We,Ã¶ he said. Ã´We.Ã¶  WeÃ†d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brotherÃ†s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. TheyÃ†ll tell you. Call them!
Do you think weÃ†d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
No. Not us...
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
The staff donÃ†t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldnÃ†t take any more...
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
So you did talk about it, huh?
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
I donÃ†t know. EveryoneÃ†s dead...
Why the hell couldnÃ†t you divorce the man?
You wouldnÃ†t understand.
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Yes. IÃ†m trying to reach a friend but I canÃ†t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
A call box? ThatÃ†s odd. Where exactly?
Can you tell me how you spell...
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Croissants. Like that...
The word for those things is croissants.
May I ask where youÃ†re from, Mr Lamont?
YouÃ†re a long way from home...
You wouldnÃ†t have a cigarette, would you?
I donÃ†t smoke. If you could get to the point...
YouÃ†re sure you wonÃ†t sit down, Miss Stewart?
IÃ†m fine standing, thank you.
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
I canÃ†t believe this...  WhatÃ†s coming now, eh? If I donÃ†t pay all HellÃ†s gonna break loose, is that it?
Well, IÃ†d sooner mug an old lady...
You...  Jesus Christ!
Okay. The woman just canÃ†t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why canÃ†t you go to your Embassy?
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnÃ†t have any. I used a British passport. My nameÃ†s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why canÃ†t you go back there?
By your Austrian?
Yeah.
You donÃ†t know why heÃ†s come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
No. A poor little rich boy who thought heÃ†d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile IÃ†d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I thought youÃ†d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... ThereÃ†s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
I know where to look.
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it wonÃ†t be for a couple of hours.
ThereÃ†ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, itÃ†s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
I wouldnÃ†t mind. Thank you.
A recent acquisition. WeÃ†ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flatÃ†s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
No answer. You have no passport and your EmbassyÃ†s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
IÃ†m sure IÃ†ll find a way.
Like youÃ†ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what weÃ†re doing here?
How come youÃ†re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
ItÃ†s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnÃ†t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
A criminal?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnÃ†t I hear you right?
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my sonÃ†s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... ThereÃ†s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youÃ†re hungry.
Thank you. But I think IÃ†ll go to bed. ItÃ†s been a long day.
Right... Well, IÃ†ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
DonÃ†t fall asleep with your hair wet.
What am I to do with the packages if...
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Get a pen and donÃ†t ask any questions.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. ThereÃ†s a dirt track with a Ã¦Closed to the publicÃ† sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havenÃ†t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldnÃ†t come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
Look, you donÃ†t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnÃ†t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? WhoÃ†s the guy? The Austrian?
WhoÃ†s the guy? WhoÃ†s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate IÃ†d have had to kill him.
What...?
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. ThereÃ†s a lot of people back there. TheyÃ†re holding a seminar. TraffickingÃ†s the past, breeding the future...
FriedmanÃ†s dead... They killed him...
Some Italian I picked up back there. HeÃ†s in the boot of the Mustang.
Italian? The Mafia...?
Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
WeÃ†re both thinking the same thing, right?
Do you know a friendly cop?
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
That-that wonÃ†t do. ThatÃ†s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thatÃ†s the way...
IÃ†m finished here and IÃ†m tired, Emily. You shouldnÃ†t be here. Now donÃ†t make it worse.
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think IÃ†ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itÃ†ll be too late.
Then find another way.
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For godÃ†s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
Damn it! You canÃ†t fucking walk away from this!
ItÃ†s up to you whether they walk or not.
...IÃ†m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thatÃ†s who I am. Do you get what IÃ†m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
What about your friendly cop?
My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks IÃ†m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But heÃ†s a good guy. HeÃ†ll listen to you. He wonÃ†t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
TheyÃ†d never let me go. And youÃ†d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Huh! And they say charityÃ†s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
ThatÃ†s right. WhereÃ†s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
No. YouÃ†re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Shit! Fuck! WhatÃ†s fucking wrong with people!  IÃ†m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!
IÃ†m calling about the puppies.
I saw the ad at GeorgeÃ†s.  IÃ†m passing through town and IÃ†m in a hurry.
Why?
What sort have you got?
Yeah.
What about an untrained pup, white...
Tomorrow?
I see. How much?
What...?
Where is the Austrian?
You... Fuck you!
YouÃ†re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Jee... Fuck... YouÃ†re fucking mad!
Who are you?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Yes. FriedmanÃ†s the fuckinÃ† Austrian!
Where is he?
I donÃ†t know. HeÃ†s gone!  HeÃ†s gone. I donÃ†t fucking know where, I swear... HeÃ†s gone. On holiday...
...On holiday?
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
WhoÃ†s the money man?
Who?  Martin... HeÃ†s Martin...
Ever seen him before?
No... No...  I swear...
Where?
What?
Where are we?
Finsbury Park. WeÃ†re in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
What kids?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
I donÃ†t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I donÃ†t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thatÃ†s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
And who does Friedman work for?
I donÃ†t know. I donÃ†t know, man. I donÃ†t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, youÃ†ve got to get me out of here...
How many of you scumbags are here?
Just me...  MartinÃ†s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
WhatÃ†s the Ambassador?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. HeÃ†s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
What about the staff?  TheyÃ†re in on whatÃ†s going on, arenÃ†t they?  How many of them?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
B-Black...
Where is it?
IÃ†ll call again.
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
You sure you passed on my message?
How are you, Jane?
No.
Good.
Should I?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
ItÃ†s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Well, I hope youÃ†re not too heartbroken and...
Bye bye, Jane. And donÃ†t be naughty.
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trÃžs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandÃšmes services Ã“quelquÃ†un rÃšcemment... Vous Ã›tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie...
ItÃ†s not.
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. ItÃ†s important.
IÃ†d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you canÃ†t, donÃ†t worry about it. IÃ†ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but IÃ†m in a hurry.
Hello, Jane. ItÃ†s me.
Carlos De Moraes?
Thank you, Jane.
May I...?
I hope itÃ†s not too significant.
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnÃ†t like to think IÃ†d kept you waiting for nothing.
Recommended?
DidnÃ†t you say I came recommended?  ThatÃ†s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Look Mrs Spitz... I donÃ†t know to whom IÃ†m indebted for the recommendation but... IÃ†m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
I take it your son is called Leon?
Check with your sonÃ†s bank. Banks donÃ†t usually give out information about their customers.
I didnÃ†t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
I presume you checked your sonÃ†s apartment...
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Then why arenÃ†t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
Any friends?
IÃ†m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
My rates...
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boyÃ†s education.
What happens now?
We conclude our transaction.
The roomÃ†s yours for 24 hours. ItÃ†s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Anything at all?
Vous Ã›tes FranÃ¾ais?
Is my money in there?
Uh-huh. You couldÃ†ve waited for me inside.
LetÃ†s go.
I donÃ†t know what your problem is, but...
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Clients come and go.
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Look, I donÃ†t think youÃ†re fully aware of what youÃ†re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why donÃ†t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
This car needs petrol.
YouÃ†re out of your mind. WhatÃ†s the idea?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Huh. IÃ†d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientÃžle. Get rid of them and weÃ†re out of business.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe I donÃ†t.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who canÃ†t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyÃ†re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Huh... IÃ†m sure thereÃ†d be lots of takers.
Where's Leeloo?
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Is this Friedman?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. YouÃ†ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name heÃ†s using?
YouÃ†re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guyÃ†s not one of FriedmanÃ†s...
You seem very sure about that.
I told you... The rabble, itÃ†s me...  Huh... ItÃ†s sad.
What is?
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Trying to say something, Martin?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Yeah.
Three oÃ†clock.
What is it?
What are you talking about?
Should I come back in five minutes?
Have you?
I donÃ†t recollect mentioning a friend.
An Austrian.
IÃ†ll be alone.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
How are you, Rhian?
ItÃ†s wet. Will this do?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Should I be?
Can I get up now?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
HavenÃ†t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? IÃ†d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Shut up!
Did Leon tell you why he didnÃ†t want the police involved, Rhian?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
IÃ†m afraid I donÃ†t understand.
Do you know LeonÃ†s parents names?
Who else knows about the boy?
Is she on the phone?
I canÃ†t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. WhatÃ†s your sisterÃ†s number?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If LeonÃ†s Austrian was looking for you I reckon heÃ†d have found you before I did.
WhatÃ†s the date?
IÃ†ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
HowÃ†s the boy doing?
Good. You neednÃ†t worry about the Austrian anymore. HeÃ†s dead. IÃ†ll be in touch.
No...
I... How long have I been here?
Los Angeles?
IÃ†d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnÃ†t appeal to you...
Excuse me?
Uh-huh.
I take it you donÃ†t know where he is, then?
What about his girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Could that be Camden Market?
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en prÃš- pubescents.
WhatÃ†s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Viens.
Tu sais oÂ¨ me trouver.
Mon bureau coÂ¹tait trop cher.
Alors?
Le montage, lÃ†emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectorsÃ† stuff. How much would it cost me?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
I donÃ†t have your credentials, Nathalie.
If you can, send me a receipt.
Okay, shitbag. IÃ†m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Gluck.
Five seconds. Then you die.
Three...
Why did you kill Friedman?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Are you telling me Friedman didnÃ†t tell you I was here looking for him?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
YouÃ†re sure he said his caller was a man?
Shut up and walk...
DonÃ†t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Moreau? CÃ†est moi. Alors...
They lost their son. Why?
Are they still operative?
Mossad?
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Who?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
I just found a picture of you.
Like shit.
I'm not hungry.
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
What's the matter with you?
What's this?  Why did you change it?
You've seen enough.
You know I don't feel well.
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Now.
Now?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
I don't know.
I have to... he's a G-34
Then why did you bring it up?
I haven't done anything.
I've never been under the table before.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Looks like dirt.
Look, food!
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Looks like food.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
What?
It's 3+27 hundred
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
Don't take anything.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
No....I though  I'm afraid.
You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
What?
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
But...you...
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
I don't want to lose you.
I don't know.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
You don't know.  You don't....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Don't let them separate us.
Are you all right?
AH UGH.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
no...no, no.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
It's the end.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
No!...No!...
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
THX and me.
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled...
Where is LUH?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
Where's LUH?
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
You're in violation.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
I'll report you.  It's....
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
Get out of here, Leave me alone.
What?
I'm leaving.
When?.....How?
Right now.
But you can't...you.
What?
Look!
What are you doing here?
...and you're not lost now?
No, I...
Which way?
That way.
How do you know?
Look more closely.
Too late....stay close.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
Maternity ward, huhh!
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
What kind of answer is that?
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
I don't care.
What was that....
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
What have you done, Cut your hand?
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read Level 842CON G
All the insides are gone!
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
I knew him.
Shut up.
That's not it.
No?
She's not there
No......  She's dead THX........
Remember this...?
Where's LUH?
Look more closely.
No...no you're wrong.
I'm only trying to help you.
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Save yourself....
Just look at all those people.
I thought of something.....
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
...to me.  I think I'm dying.
You should know better than that!
Where did you get this?
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
Alright, let's check it out.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
Treat. We treat devices.
Don't push it, slick.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
Only once, at Redstone.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us punks happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Drive.
Then let's go see what they missed.
So what were they doing here?
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
This is where the van was parked.
Bingo!
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Right.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things...
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
How long were you hooked?
You don't have to talk about it.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Ex-girlfriend?
What's up?
How do you know?
Should we head for the Interstate?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
You got it.
Off the scale.
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Don't touch that.
Stay to your left.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
I don't know.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
No excuses, just do it!
Easy, guys.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
It's from an IRA.
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
We work fast enough for you?
Political.
Any word?
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
C4, plastic explosive.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
A bowling alley.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Alright!
Reilly! He's loaded!
Hello?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Leeloo..
...'Scuse me?
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
We'll see about that.
How did you get this number?
I'm on my way.
Sir Elliot.
I see.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
I can feel your pain.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
So why did you leave?
And still not a thing to watch.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
...Words to live by?
Briefly.
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
I'm sure they will.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Instant melt down.
I'd rather die alone.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
I appreciate your time -
Where can I find him?
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
- We all want what we can't have?
What - no lust for adventure?
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
four wheel drive?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Yes -
Wait a minute -
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
I know what I saw -
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Is this another one of your games?
Nothing.
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Do you?
Shhhhh...
Paris -
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Political considerations?
It must do something.
How is old Q?
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
... Shoelaces?
Does it work on cash machines?
I see...
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
That's reassuring.
Hey - the world is my office.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Step into my office.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Natalya?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
He tied one on.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Who knows? Fog, night...
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
That's reassuring.
Sidney Winch, meet -
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Where to now, Jimbo?
Interesting presentation.
They point, I shoot.
Of course.
Depends what number you write.
Married?
... Kids?
No.
Thanks.  Take care -
And I bet you always Leave turmoil in your wake.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
I'll keep that in mind.
Nice to run into you again.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
I hope so.
I hope you'll be gentle.
the family jewels?
If I were you -
Why don't we just take these -
... Do you have a gun?
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Blood or Dutch?
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Up.
Trust me.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Sometimes you just have to -
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
We blast through.
... Yes???
... Yes?
And number two?
Yes, M.
Of course.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
I understand.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Sorry I'm late -
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
It doesn't quite add up.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
... And what do you call these?
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Remind me.
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
...What's your name?
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
I appreciate you coming in so early.
I don't know what you mean.
I... I don't really know.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
Why are you talking like that?
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Arnie, this is crazy.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
What is he being charged with?
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
If all our assets are frozen and our sales force has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
Helena --
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
Did you get it?
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
What?
I was just waiting for the right time.
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Carl --
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
That's frustrating.
It's so frustrating.
I think she's lying.
Me, too.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Why?
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
How long have you known?
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Barbara --
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Oh, it is?
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
Should we bring the police into this?
No, not yet.
About the other night, I'm sorry.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
I don't know.
So's the video camera.
At least she's alive.
Where are you going?
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Honey, your father knows the President.
Caroline --
I don't know.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Hi.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say please or thank you.
Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some face time.
It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Oh, yes I can.
I feel good.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Nope.
Chill out --
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
That's a big word for a fisherman.
Who do you work for?
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
She ain't in on it.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
You want to make a wager on this?
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
Are you getting this on tape?
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
What do we do?
I don't know.
What do you think she wants?
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
Depends who it's from.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
I'll put this in the back.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Especially Tiger Woods.  ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
David --
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
When will you do it?
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
We can protect you.
So you pay off our customs officials?
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
That thought makes me feel awful.
You're breaking my heart.
...Hello?
Hi Ma...
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
I don't think you're going to do that.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
Not in...
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
You will help me with my other problem.
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
Noriega is a criminal.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Any idea how much?
What do you look for?
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
Just tell me where she is.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
What?
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Hello.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Who are these guys?
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
Who do we interface with on their side?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
Yes ma..
Qual se tu?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
With a starship!
It could. Yes.
He has his doubts...
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
The ship....
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
It runs deep. Share it with me.
A Federation starship.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
What's going on?
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Bob?
You caught me on my way to the shower.
On The Planet Of Galactic Peace?
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Oh, please.
Have the Klingons responded?
Understood. Kirk out.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
If we could send a distress signal...
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Put it on the screen.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Transporter room. Status.
Go, Sulu.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
And that is?
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
MM.?
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
Oh, God
Perhaps because it is there is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
I don't understand.
I've always known... I'll die alone.
What are you doing?
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
Are we leaving, Captain?
Row, row, row your boat... I love Row...  Do - do you know Row
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Captain?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Jim.
Yes, Spock?
Life is not a dream.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Goodnight, Spock.
I could use a shower.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
But he does seem familiar?
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
I do not often think of the past.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
What do you mean?
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Why?
He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
Fascinating.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Damn.  Let's go.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Spock.
Yes, Captain?
Be one with the horse.
Yes, Captain.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
Let me do something.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
If you think it would help.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
I did not.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
I have a half brother.
I gotta sit down.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
There's got to be a way out of this place.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
How do you know?
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
He did have pointed ears.
Is it possible?
Is what possible?
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
I am here, Captain.
That's a little vague, Spock -
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an s.
c.... k.
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Hmmm?
It would appear we are too heavy.
It must be all those marsh melons.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Fire the rockets!
Spock.
The emergency channel, open.
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
...mark two.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
Spock... don't.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
What is this?
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Spock?
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
Not possible. You were never alone.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
Who are you?
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
No! No reply. Remain on course.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
Other than that... You all right?
What are you doing?
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
We must change our course at once.
I trust your message was received?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
I'm afraid of nothing.
Sha Ka Ree. The Scource. Heaven. Eden. call it Qui'Tu. To the Romulans, it's Vorta Vor. The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No... I didn't.
Now learn something about yourself.
No. I refuse.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Your vision?
You are mad!
Am I? We'll see.
About the ship...
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
No conditions.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
Because you, too, must know.
What have I done?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
Spock...
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Sybok, you must surrender.
No. You must kill me.
No. I will not.
You know I'm right.
Each man's pain is unique.
I know you better than that.
Do you?
Spock?
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
I belong here.
I don't understand...
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Sybok, we must find a way...
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Embezzling is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has invented -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Hi, Alan.
My dinner.
Want one?
I know, I met him.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Come on in...
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
What do you mean, 'yes?
Oh. Anything else?
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
I'm your program?
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
Way to go! We're haulin'!
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
This town's full o' live ones.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Let's get outta here.
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
Flynn?
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Cute.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
The Pentagon?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
You wouldn't dare.
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
It can be arranged...
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Well I want to communicate --
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
Dumont!
Alan!
Where did you hear that name?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
What, just the three of us?
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
How about over there...that empty memory?
No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
Flynn!!
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Yeah, I... oops!
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Wrote the...?
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Stranger and stranger...
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
What about our friend - Sark?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Did we make it?
Yes.
How about you?
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
There's another beam!
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Probably.
Shhhhh.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Tron...?
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Watch it!
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Well...my home sector was called Paramus ...
It grows on you.
Feel what? You okay?
What's goin' on?
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Hey... !
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
So...how's the world of serious science?
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
Do it!
Yori... hey...
That's all going to change, Yori...
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
I had to...in the games...
As long as it gets us out of here
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
What is it?
We have to get off this beam!
Nice...
Where's Flynn?
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Yeah.  You know Harry.
You bitch.
Simon?  Ohmygod.
Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
Where are you going?
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
That's not true, honey--
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Out.
Where are you off to young lady?
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
You seem fine now.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Dana, are you listening to me?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
How was school today?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
You're kidding.
Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
Harry!  Where are you!
Harry?  HARRY?!
What's this for?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
What a team.  See you at eight.
Thanks dear.
Here, check these out.
Son of a bitch!
What?
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen.  Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
No way.  Not Dana.
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
Will you just open the door!					*
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
I thought you moved out.
Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
In her dreams.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Yeah, right.
Station wagon?
Helen's going to be pissed.
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
What's the plan?
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
There's another guy, still in the car.
Stay on him.
Copy that.
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Okay.  Here she comes.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?

Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Just hang a minute.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
She's having an affair.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
I still don't believe it.
Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
Guy's a spook!
Yeah, but for who?							*
He could be working her to get to you.
Give me the page.
What are you talking about?
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
She's still at my house.						*
The purse is still at the house.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
She's lying.
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
She could be telling the truth.
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
Now what?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
Here they come.
Any minute now.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
He's got it.
But you didn't.  Why not?
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
No!  Never!
So, it was your first time.
I wasn't cheating!
My husband is a good man.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
You're not going anywhere.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
And you still reach for your piece every time.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
I adore it.
I'd like that.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Is that why you got into this business?
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Yes.
Uh, yes, it is important.
Oral hygiene?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
Okay.
I'm late.
Me too.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
That's fabulous Harry.
Yeah, it was wild.
Uh huh.  Okay.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
What did you tell him?
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Good thinking, honey.
I'll handle it.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
Yeah.  It was great.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
What'd you do, honey?
Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
My husband the hero.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
They must've just missed me.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
What did happen?
He needed my help.
Not because you were attracted to him?
No.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Well, maybe a little.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Would you say he was boring, then?
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
And you agreed?
Why?
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
What did you need?
I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
No.
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Answer the question--
What?
Do you still love your husband?
Yes.
Louder please.
I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
Yes or no.
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
My husband can't know about this.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
I can do it!
Natasha?
No.  Doris.
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
Sure, hon.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
What were you doing there?
You wouldn't believe me.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
I'm sorry, honey.
Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
What did he give you?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
It makes you tell the truth?
Is it working yet?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Are we going to die?
Yup.										*
17 years.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
I don't take those assignments.
What about Juno?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Did you pork her Harry?
No.  But I wanted to.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Looks that way.
Harry... snap out of it!
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
What?
Do you still love me?
Yes.
As much as you used to?
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Oh shit.
Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
Dance?
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
Absolutely.
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
And you've got one.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
So what's your angle?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
What about the husbands?
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Those idiots.
You working on someone right now?
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
What does she do?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
Beat it.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
He said he was an American agent.
What?
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--
What's going on, Harry?
Fuck you.
Hello?
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
Yes.  Go ahead.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
I understand.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Worse than Cairo?							*
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Did you read the papers yesterday?
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot...
That was you?!
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
Tell me what happened?
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
You'll call me then?
Yes.  Now go.
To our assignment.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
I'm married!
We're going to Paris?
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
I don't know.  I have to think...
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
Helen.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
I just glances inside.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Hello, Alabama.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
What letter?
What letter?
Yes.
Not yet.
Nope.
Let me speak to Clarence.
He wants to speak with you.
You're gonna be on T.J. Hooker?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
You can't have just one.
This is great, we got cable.
You got that playing basketball?
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
The forager's back.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
I didn't get any chicken.
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Don't eat anything.
Yeah?
...Not yet.
The letter I sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Ya looked through it?
Tell him to look through it.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Bye-bye.
Now hang up.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, Get her in here.. He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
The oriental.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Want some Goobers?
Thanks a lot.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Sonny kicks ass.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the Streetfighter. It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Is that your real name? Really?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
I took a cab.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Sure. Why not?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
What time is it?
'Bout twelve.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
I'd love some pie.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.
What do you want to know?
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Ask me them again. One by one.
What do you do?
I don't remember.
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
What's your favorite color?
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
What's your favorite movie star?
Burt Reynolds.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Yes, I would.
Very much. Now, where were we?
What kinda music do you like?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like He's a Rebel.
What are your turn-ons?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Turn-offs?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Do you have a fella?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Wow. What a swell place to work.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
How long have you worked here?
Almost four years.
That's a long time.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
Do you get paid a lot?
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what Spiderman number one looks like?
You bet. How much is that worth?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. Man from U.N.C.L.E. Lunch boxes. Green Hornet board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
What's that?
That's a Rookies doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in The Black Hole? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
God, Spiderman looks different.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
Five.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
You know when you sat behind me?
What would make you think that?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
I love Janis.
She OD'd, didn't she?
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
You mean she got a bad batch?
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, Look
So he really loved her?
Uh-huh.
You didn't do nothing.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
You're a whore?
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
Heroes For Sale?
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
That dazzling imagination.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: Dear Clarence. I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, Alabama
Who and what is a Drexl?
My pimp.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Is he black?
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Is he nice?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
What did he do to Arlene?
This motherfucker sounds charming!
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in Dressed to Kill. And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Will you be my wife?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Did ya ever see The Chinese Professionals?
I don't believe so.
I do.
Thank you.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
Where you goin', honey?
I just gotta get somethin'.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
What?
Write down Drexl's address.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
You don't know him -
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
Was it him or you?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, If I can kill 'em and get away with it
Is this a joke?
I think what you did was...
What?
What?
... was so romantic.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
Really?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
How come?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
What?
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Cancoon.
Why Cancoon?
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
What?
Live with what?
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Yeah.
You wanna get unhaunted?
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
You'd really do that?
He don't got no right to live.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
I don't blame you.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: I'll take that gun, You'll have to.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved Coming Home in a Body Bag.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
She's with me.
No thanks.
Clarence?
You got it.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Tomorrow.
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Get the fuck outta here!
I'm a married man.
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
What?
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Ask him if he got the letter.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Money problems?
Now tell him goodbye.
That's a pretty amazing story.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
You goin' out?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
Good for you.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
Every word of it.
You're really in love, aren't you?
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
This shit can't be real.
It'll get ya high.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
I certainly hope so.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
I know.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Tell me.
This is Drexl's coke?
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot.
Elliot what?
The zoo.
What's to think about?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Two guys.
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Let me handle this.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
I got the part on T.J. Hooker.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
Clarence.
Yeah?
Um, nothing, let's go?
In case.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
Do you really mean it?
This is our last chance to play what if. I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
No. But thanks.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
Really?
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. The Streetfighter, Return of the Streetfighter, and Sister Streetfighter.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Want an animal cracker?
Yeah, OK.
Leave the gorillas.
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
Look, Dick, I don't -
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
What department?
What do you think, eightball?
The police department?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
He trusts you?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
What?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
No problems on both counts.
Where's everybody else?
They'll be along.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
I guess so. Follow me.
Elliot.
Yeah?
Get on your knees.
Don't you?
No.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. No you're not.
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I don't know, Clarence, Doctor Zhivago is a pretty big movie.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to Doctor Zhivago are in arbitration?
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these Soldier of Fortune poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you Coming Home in a Body Bag is one of my favorite movies. After Apocalypse Now I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Hello?
...Ma???
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Where'd you go?
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
We grew up together.
I bullshitted him.
Wanna count your money?
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
I can, but I don't.
That's about all I ever eat.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
I'm really not very -
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
I really don't know.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
She seems very nice.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
You were a cop.
What makes you think I would do that?
I'm your son.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always OK, No problem, You're a busy guy
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
No shit?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Nope.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
I give up. Who are you?
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
I've seen him.
What are you talkin' about?
I don't believe you.
On their honeymoon.
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
You and Robin moved?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Thank you.
Sure. No problem.
Absolutely.
Where'd he come from?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
Uh-huh.
Sure was.
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Not a tiny little vial -
But a fuckin' baggie.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
You're no longer an extra -
Or a bit player -
Or a supporting actor -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
Nicholson and I.
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
Suspect's words -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He produced Coming Home in a Body Bag.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
You do more than try.
You do.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
He knows.
How the fuck could he know?
He saw the wire.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
He knows something's up.
We gotta get him outta there.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
You gotta hold this for me.
Just put it in your purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Put it in your pants.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Uh, I didn't hear the...
No, sir!
Uh, what?
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
I DON'T WANT YOUR WOMEN
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it...dimensions. It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
I understand.  There'd be no point.
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
They forced me to take drugs.
I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
I need to go now.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
What kind of information?
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
Change what?
I need to go.
Do you know why you're here, James.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
No.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
You wouldn't understand.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
I have to go.
Underground.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
I have to go.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
This is April, right?
July.
July?!
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
No, 1995 is the past.
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
It's just a shot to calm you.
I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
You used to call me James.
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
Never cry wolf!
What?
My father told me that.  Never cry wolf.  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
If something really happens...like what, James?
Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
I'm not going to do anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
They're keeping an eye on me.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
Are you hurt?
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
I've got one now.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
James, why don't we...?
Lock it now!
Mason???
Jeffrey Mason?
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
The guy was a total fruitcake.
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
You smell so good.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
See -- you can drive after all!
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
What made you think that?
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
I'm...mentally divergent.  I would love to believe that.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
Give me the gun.
You're sure?
No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
I don't understand what we're doing.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
I thought I was in...prison again.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
It was?  I didn't...know.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
What does this mean to you?
...I had a dream about...something like that.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
I...I...We need cash, James.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
You... you left them a message?
I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Flowers!  What flowers?
Why are we doing this?
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, voice mail.  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
I need to make a telephone call.
A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
Germs?!
What about the germs?  I say.  He goes, I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap! Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
What's that mean?
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about you know what.
You know -- your plan.
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
It's private.
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
What...???
Not, what, babe!  When!
You do know me.  You helped me once.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Excuse me -- what did you say?
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The Immaculate Escape -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?  You do remember that, don't you?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, Hey
Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...
JOSE!
Jo...Jose????
How did you find me?
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Who am I supposed to shoot?
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Uh, that message...me?
I couldn't call!  You sent me to the wrong year!  It was 1989.
Yes, sir.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
He was fully sedated!
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
And what we believe is what's accepted as truth now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
You develop viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever developed a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC?
You really want to know?
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous pretend-friend-to- animals?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
He's been tested for drugs?
You have him in restraints.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
Nine thirty
What?  What did you say?
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Thanks for reminding me..
I'm sorry..
Hey!  You there!
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Christ no!
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
I said I was sorry.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Christ!
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Hell no!
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
That a fact?
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
What?
...And everything is nothing too.
All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that om! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, the more you eat
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. Are you a human being -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
You are crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
You know I won't be seeing you.
I wasn't doing anything.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Mister!
Oh, shit!
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
A lot that means.
Grace, tell him.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
You broke my nose!
It ain't broke.
What the fuck do you want?
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
Yeah...
Say, what happened to your hand?
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
Darrell's a moron.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Wait a second--
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Hey!
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
You can't shoot 'em! I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Would you?
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
What can I do for you, lad?
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
About what you said this morning.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
I'm not rambling.
You're talking like a madman.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
And what does that make you?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You love her, but you hate her?
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
How much could you get?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
How do you want it?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! You want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I know you...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
No!
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
It's not what you think, Jake.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
Shhh! Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
What are you talking about!
Come on, Jake --
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Two-hundred dollars?
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
What?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Oz.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
You're too quick for me.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
What the hell are you talking about?
What's your name anyway?
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Will you shut up!
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Get away from me!
You Harlin?
Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.
Will he be back soon?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
You own this place?
Yep.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
So?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
Darrell--
OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Great!
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
How much time?
Time.
Twenty-after-ten.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Accident.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
Hey.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
How much!?
Hundred-fifty.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
You've been there?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Two-hundred.
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
What sign?
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, who knows me.
No! Okay! Okay!
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Darrell.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
What you want?
Open up!
We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up.
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
You got the money?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
No.
Got any cold soda?
Soda.  You know.
No! No police.
I'm just going to my car?
That's right on my way.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
I like that about me, beautiful.
It's Grace.
May I carry your package, Grace?
Jesus.
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
No, I've got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You should be more careful.
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
No trouble at all, really.
Wasn't nothing.
Thank you, Bobby.
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I just drove in this morning.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Where you coming from?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
You've been around.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens when you lose?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice place.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
I guess it must.
What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
Come here.
The same thing you do.
What?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Like you.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
I have an idea.
And what would that be?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
You never did answer my question.
Still playing?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
Are there snakes out here?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Did you ever?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Is that why you're with him?
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
I'm guessing no.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You could leave him.
I don't know how.
Walk away.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
What's the matter?...Grace?
Nothing.
Don't feel like nothing.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
You'd never understand.
Try me.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
You mean the Shaman?
He was a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his little halfbreed... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
Yeah.
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted more. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, really taken -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
I'm sorry...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Yeah.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
Is it pretty?
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
Honey, baby, I can't. I can't even get out of here myself. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Where?
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
What do you mean?
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
Kill him.
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Stop it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
The money's right here! Get the key!
No! You get it!
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
I can't see it.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I don't know about that?
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
I'm not sailing his boat.
But I thought --
Anywhere?
You already have.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
What are you talking about?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and me.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
He was a scumbag!... He wanted me, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're dead...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
Why?
I don't know why!
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
You could give me my gun back.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
My mother died in this canyon.
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
Hope is a four-letter word.
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
I busted my leg!
Can you make it back up?
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
Why's that?
'Cause I love you.
Jake...
He can't help you now, honey!
Harlin's.
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets robbed!
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they both get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
With a shotgun!  She kills both of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
Out of here.
How much?
One way.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You got a beer?
Beck's.
Heineken?
Genuine Draft?
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
Sure, I'll try.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Anybody hurt?
No baby, you got it wrong.
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
Who was that on the phone?
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
You haven't even looked at them once.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
No! No! Please!
What's the matter?
You didn't hear something?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
There's someone in the house.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Like you helped her, Jake?
I axed you a question.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
I want to stay.
I said come on!
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Is Noel in?
Oh.
Wow.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Yes.
Once again please?
How old is Jeb?
No.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
I'm listening.
What about Jeb?
I don't think I got the job in New York.
I know.
He's asleep.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Found it?
Yes.
When was the last time I wore pink?
Oh.
Megan?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
I remember you.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
Would you like to try going--
out again?
Jesus.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
...I think rust.
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
What was that?
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
I'm not sure.
What about the game?
You've never been sick?
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Seventy-five percent.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
What's he talking about?
In college. A car accident.
Was it serious?
You assumed wrong.
You forgot the Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on step. See usually that comes before the, It's over Step. And it always, always comes before the You can go Step.  What is over?
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
What was your idea Elijah?
At the church... You were following me weren't you?
Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
What do you want?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
We've already begun.
Are you for real?
Just give me a minute.
Is there a problem?
That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
I thought he was carrying something.
But not a knife?
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
Like what?
Telling when people have done something wrong?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
You're skill.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
Quick.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
That's not what I witnessed David.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
Are you finished?
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's doing well today.
He's kind of a miracle.
What's he look like?
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Yeah?
When?
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
Why'd you do that?
There's nothing to do.
No.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
No.
No Jeremy.
How much did you take off?
Two hundred and seventy.
What do you do if something happens?
How many did you put on that time?
I see.
That's great.
Know what?
Elijah was wrong.
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
Jeremy listen to what--
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
You like sports?
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
Not really.
Yeah, hello.
He doesn't look very threatening.
Okay.
Fine.
Against a window.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
No.
How long have you been married?
How did you get together?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
How so?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Why?
Where is it?
...Hi.
Uh... not really.
Jack. What are you doing here?
Yeah.
There was ninety-one million -
Who ?
And ?
I'm having a stroke.
Just forget about it.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
Goddamnit.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
They'll never stop.
They ruined me tonight.
Alright.
That's enough, Edie.
Edie, please.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
A glass of water would be nice.
Umm ...
This whole thing was a shakedown.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
I don't want to know.
This is not right.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
He's alright.
Why don't you just calm down'
Dig.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
What are we gonna do?
Did you hear what he just said?
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
How do you do?
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Get out.
If you'll just let me -
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
You have to come.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
Tough break.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
I was out of line.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
How are they going to do it?
Fenster and Hockney?
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Three million?
No killing?
Not if we do it my way.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
We'll make it.
What is it Keaton?
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
What is this?
Who's Keyser Soze?
What-are they speaking?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Keaton, I can't just -
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
What time is it?
Let's say for example -
with what?
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
Who's your boss?
You set up the line-up.
What about Redfoot?
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Neither do we.
We'll see.
What did you say?
You're lying.
We're on vacation.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
You didn't know.
Who is he?
What do you mean I can't see him?
Did they charge him with anything?
What'the fuck is that?
When does he post bail?
I want to see him.
Someplace else, then.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
I'11 find him.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Nothing. Something I - forget it.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
You know damn well what I think.
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Kobayashi.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
I told the D.A. everything I know.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
I know he was good.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
I just want to hear your story.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
No.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
That was all Fenster and McManus.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
What lawyer?
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
So this lawyer...
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
This is totally irrelevant.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
You're stalling, Verbal.
What happened?
Then what?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
What call?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
I don't.
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
But Keaton...
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I never heard of him.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
I said I never heard of him.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
He wanted me to live.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
Edie.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Because he was my friend.
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
No...
Keaton was Keyser Soze
NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
Edie...
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
This is all bullshit.
I knew him. He would never -
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
You're not safe on your own.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Yeah, very big, a giant.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
You don't have to do it for a living.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
Like all this.
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
No, I'm all right.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the old college gang; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Then?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
From whom?
Someone dead.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
How often does this happen?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Where'd she go?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
Well?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
I want you.
It's not my line.
How can I see her, to know her?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Ernie's.
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Yes.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
But you knew about this.
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
She is not my wife.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
I -- I --
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
Hello.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Hello?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
Just let me talk to you.
You.
Why?
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
You're not far wrong.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
You won't have to.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
What do you want to know?
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
And how you happen to be Living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
I told you! Right here!
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Salina, Kansas!
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Will you have dinner with me?
Why?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
Because I remind you of her?
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
An hour?
Mmm.
Okay.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Don't go.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No? Then what?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd take care of me?
Yes.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
No.
That's not very complimentary, either.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
Please! And don't look at me.
Will you, Judy?
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
I like that one.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Yes --
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
I want to! Come on!
But I like that one, Scottie.
No, it's not right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But why?
You want me to dress like her?
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Judy --
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
I don't like it!
We'll take it! Will it fit?
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
You can.
No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go...
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
You don't even want to touch me.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Ah, no!
Yes.
Well?
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Wherever you'd like...
Ernie's?
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Well, after all, it's our place.
Mmmm.
Is that the best you can do?
Come here.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
That's what I had in mind.
Too late. I've got my face on.
No, Ernie's is fine.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
All in good time.
Scottie!
Can't you see?
Oh, yeah. There.
No, it's all right.
To complete my cure.
Scottie, why are we here?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
But why? Why here?
Madeleine died here.
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
I need you.
Why?
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
I'm scared.
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, If lose me
Scottie --
-- and wanted to go on loving you. And I said
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
Take me away...
No!
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Scottie, please...!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Yes!
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Yes!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
I don't know... Switzerland?
What are you going to do?
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
What are you going to do?
I loved you, Madeleine.
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Why am I here? What happened?
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
No...
Do you remember where you were?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Where were you?
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
Why?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Where had you been before?
When?
This afternoon.
Oh... wandering about.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Wandering about.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
No.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
Oh! Yes! Here!
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
I... didn't know where you lived.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
My name is John Ferguson.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Wander about.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
No... it's wrong.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Not at all, I enjoyed --
talking to you...
I enjoyed talking to you.
Would you like some coffee?
No! No, thank you!
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
Meet again, sometime.
Good-bye.
I don't know.
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
Do you know where you're going?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
How can you be sure?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
How old?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
The oldest living things?
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Why?
Knowing I have to die...
Do you hear anything?
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
Would you like a drink of water?
No, thank you.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Madeleine!
Where are you now?
Where?
The tall trees...
Yes...
When?
Where were you born?
Long ago...
Where?
No!... No!
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
No, don't ask me!
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
Why did you jump?
What was it inside that told you to jump?
What?!
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
Home?
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
Yesterday.
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
Vaguely...
What do you remember?
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
Would you know the room?
Where?
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
I know.
There's a name on the gravestone.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
What else?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
No.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
All the time.
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
Why? What's happened?
No, don't go away!
Only this far.
Where's your husband?
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Yes --
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
Go on.
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
And an old wooden hotel of the old California days; And a saloon... dark... low ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Yes?! But --
It's all there. It's no dream.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
No, never!
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
Here with you.
Yes.
Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
I love you too... too late... too late...
No... we're together...
Too late... there's something I must do...
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
You can't.
Why?
Where?
Madeleine --
Please let me go.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Let me go! Let me go!!
Madeleine!!
Yes.
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
I won't lose you.
Let me go into the church alone.
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Please answer my question.
What is her name?
Carlotta Valdes?
How long has she had the room?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Would you please go and look?
Her car is gone.
Ow!!
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
What's tomorrow?
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
I had to quit, Midge.
Why?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
It wasn't your fault.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
It's where you belong.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Ah, Johnny-O...
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
From that music.
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Uh-huh!
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
What a pleasant hobby.
That's following a train of thought.
Well?
Normal.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Could be.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.
Sorry, old man. Work.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
My... the acrophobia.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
I think I can lick it.
How?
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
That!?!
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Step number two.
Okay.
Easy, now.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Johnny!
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Six to the left. One to the right.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this hello you look wonderful stuff. Just a good straight who do you know --
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Yeah.
Who?
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Do you know him well?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
The poor thing....
And she died...
For what?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Nothing to tell.
I'll take you home.
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Out!
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Is she pretty?
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Midge!
Bye-bye!
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Just wander.
Where?
Around.
Oh?
Mm. Better.
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Oh?
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh... this and that.
What I've been doing?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
What have you been doing?
Wandering.
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
No, not exactly. Want to see?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
Oh?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
By whom?
How?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
Yes! That's it!
Can we have it by tonight?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out.
Excellent.
She's fucking hot!
I need a drink.
Jesus.
Don't touch her. Call 911.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
That's a horrible ugly comment. Dead whore? She's a person!
Can't do what?
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
What did you say?
I didn't hear you.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
Sorry Fish.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
You're an asshole.
Multiple reasons.
I don't have to...
She's dead.
Playing?
Why?!
This is pathetic.
What did you say?
Don't point at me.
I have plenty of friends.
The hell I don't.
What are you fucking talking about?
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
And you're a little fucking reject.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You fucking bastard!
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Go home!
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
I'm not getting a ticket.
Don't even start.
You want to hear me out?
More.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Wait!
What?
What are you doing?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Calling the ambulance.
We have to call the ambulance.
Why?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
Are you sure this was an accident?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
Stop it!
There's more.
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
I'm calling the police.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Bury her out in the desert.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
So I didn't fucking do it!
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What about the blood?
Have you ever done this before?
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
Sun rises at 5:52.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?
We can't do this.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
So that's what we're doing.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
I am not flexible on this.
Alright. Let's do it.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
What does that mean?
You got us into this mess.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Watch the tone fella.
Fuck you Boyd!
Any time fat boy!
I can't do this.
What?
At the seven-eleven.
Who? What are you talking about?
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I don't give a damn.
Adam! Calm down.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
It has worked.
They won't figure it out.
I got children. I've got a life.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
They're driving me nuts!
What?
Later.
There is no candy!
We'll be ready Adam.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
That's one idea.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Real times.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
No. I think it's fucked.
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
Don't ever stare him down.
I won't do it.
Don't eyeball your kids.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
I know and I'm honored...
If anything ever happens to me...
I know...
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
What happened? Oh my God...
No way.
I want you to hear me out.
What.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
I don't think so.
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Have you thought about what I said?
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
I got you.
Where's the bathroom?
What are you talking about?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
Lois please.
What is it?
What?
She's not here.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Who?
Yup.
That's right.
That's right.
She's in there!
No I don't.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
But not tonight.
Not tonight.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Not without Leeloo.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
Left side.
He's right.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
I got her arm.
Here's his head.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
I'm not talking to you?
What is her disposition?
He just had two.
Give me two more.
He's too drunk.
You said that Boyd.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
We need padded chairs.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
I can't.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Call 911.
Shut up.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Oh God. This is insane.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
Good God...Good God...
I'm calling the police.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
What kind of words?
I'm talking about prayer.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
You always were a jealous man.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Shut up Boyd.
He's having a problem here.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
He's cracked up.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What?
What is the question you asked me?
I said, what have we done?
Say it again.
What?
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
What's your point?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Regarding what?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Suck my ass.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Just do it.
What are you going to do?
What does that mean?
I don't know...
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
What does that mean?
Yeah.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
That's right.
Isn't it a little late?
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
My what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Okay fine.
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
Not a prayer.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
You need help.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
The hell I did!
I never heard that.
Oh really? Starbucks?
I don't hate women.
False.
Not true.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
New king.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
Then what do they have?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
There's my point exactly.
Take Mexico.
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
We're not goosed.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Stop it!
Stop.
Give me the Valium.
Are we supposed to?
What?
Government cutbacks.
We missed the deadline.
I'm not sure.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Sent it.
Yup.
I think I forgot the tent.
I think so.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
How could I know what else I forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
I wouldn't know.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
How do you figure?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
What are you talking about?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's quiet.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
He's a great chef.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
You will not be common!!!
Of course.
With all my heart.
Okay.
I'm not. What's the problem?
What kind of seats can we have?
So what do we do?
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
We're leaving in three hours.
I'll call them from the road.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Of course.
I love you.
Hi.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
What are you doing?
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
Hey. It's me.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
Okay.
What!
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
I'm working on it.
Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
This is our honeymoon.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
I know.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Okay. Okay.
Yes.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
The prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
It's too late.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
But...
But...
What money?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
So what do we do?
What?
No...
But...
You did all right dad.
Harry Chaplin. Cats in the Cradle.
I love you dad.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
What does that mean?
About what?
I'm not breathing right.
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
He's your brother.
Go for it.
I'm getting married...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Buzzing?
I don't hear it.
Have another drink.
The wahoo?
The wahoo moment?
I think so.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
What is it?
That ought to be about the end of that.
Yup.
No...No.
How do you know she's dead.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
I'll be right back.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
I have no idea.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
A move?
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
Where's Boyd?
Downstairs in the closet.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
My God...
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading Atlas Shrugged
Did he try to kiss you?
All week long.
You alright?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping Immaculate Reception? I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I guess.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - Pup Corn.
That's right, Pup Corn. Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of Pup Corn pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes Shelmer
There.
Where?
Yeah?
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
That's a good one.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
That's what I'm thinking.
Good times.
That's right.
Shut up Micheal.
I don't think that's a good idea.
It's like a cab isn't it?
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
In English, please.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
You son-ofÃ¹aÃ¹bitch, I'm going to kill you.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
I'm getting by.
Do me a favor Ã¹Ã¹ keep sending them.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
What she's going to do is get in my way.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Their weapons missing?
Where's my gun?
You sonÃ¹ofÃ¹aÃ¹bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
Then I guess we're even.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
I should have told him.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
I need your help--
Got it.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
What's the assignment?
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Not from in here.
How do you know I won't run?
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
He hears...everything.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
Do I get to see it or not?
It's nanoÃ¹technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
It feels so.. .real.
This is supposed to be years away.
How do you kill it?
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
You need a maid.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
What's wrong with Parker?
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Then fix it.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Should I have?
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was you, wasn't it?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
My God...
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
All my work is my finest.
You catching my drift?
SID Ã¹Ã¹ NO!!!
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
I am beautiful, aren't I?
Of course you are.
How can I ever thankÃ¹you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
Help me get out of here.
Glad to...
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
You actually listen to all those tapes?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
A little less than yesterday.
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it Ã¹Ã¹ I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
Go to hell.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Enough!
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
I don't need a babyÃ¹sitter.
What you need is a collar.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
It wasn't a lie.
Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
He was reÃ¹enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better Ã¹Ã¹ to improve upon what was already done.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
I know who would know.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Do me one favor Ã¹Ã¹ if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
What are you doing?
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
I've been in prison, remember?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
I am impressed.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Who said that?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
As a matter of fact, it is.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonÃ¹of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Give me your wrist.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
She's beautiful, you know?
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Sounds to me like a wellÃ¹educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're reÃ¹adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Don't worry about it, all right?
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Relax. I know what you meant.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Don't get out of the car.
Stop me.
What the hell's going on?!
What did you do to those people?
Nothing.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Enjoying yourself?
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Tell him.
What's the problem?
I'm doing the best I can!
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
Start of what?
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
You like baseball?
Real effective security...
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Authority still makes me nervous.
Which way?
Both.
Parker -Ã¹ stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot youÃ¹Ã¹
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
We know you didn't kill those guards.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Part of him is.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
That, or living through him...
See something?
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Thanks.
Find out anything?
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Can I ask you something?
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go Ã¹Ã¹ right now.  Why are you going to do this?
You don't know?
Because this painÃ¹inÃ¹theÃ¹ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
You okay?
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
Sid?
I don't know.
Where the hell are you going?
How's your pulse?
Then shoot him already.
Duck!
What do we do now?
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Where's John?
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
The symphony of collision...
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common Ã¹Ã¹ we have such history together Ã¹Ã¹I've been thinking we should become friends.
You and me have nothing in common.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were youÃ¹Ã¹
Why's that?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Where did you plant the C-4?!
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
My...secret.
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
There you go Ã¹Ã¹ best seat in the house.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Aren't you going to watch with me?
I've got some final preparations to take care ofÃ¹Ã¹ Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
What are you talking about?
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
What did you say? What did you do?
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
What mission?
Where have I heard this song before?
Do you have a scarf?
Hey.
Yes?
It's only two hours away.
I know that.
Of course you will.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
That was very good.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
No, he wouldn't.
I think playing in a band called Bitch might put a dent in the whole perfect family thing.
That's not true.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
He loves you very much.  He just--
I know he does.
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
I miss you.
So much.
What do you mean?
I started seeing things.
A ghost?
Did you?
What?
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Then we both are.
Who's idea was it?
I didn't want to come.
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
Your husband?
Do you really think so?
Why is he worried?
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Fireball?
You're joking.
These are good.
Mm-hmm.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
How do you know it's a she?
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
What does she look like?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Fine.
What do you think I should do?
What?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think that'll help?
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
Are you humoring me?
Nope.
How?
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Well, that's what we're here for.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Yes, but...
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You think you influenced her?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
She said, You know.  That I know.
Do you?
What do you think?  Guess.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Have you been hurt?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
You were in an accident?
Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
That can't feel good.
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of empty-nest episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
I am.
Almost.
I'm sorry?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
At the party.
Who's that?
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Well maybe your wife...
When...when will she be back?
Oh-kay...
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Um...yes.
Hello?
Who?  Your husband?
What?  What are you afraid of?
Tell me.  Please.
Tell me.  I can help you.
That's not...It's not like that.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
Wait!  Don't go...
You do?
And then you weren't there.
Would you like some iced tea?
Thank you.
What?
Um...sure.
No.  No, I don't.
Mrs. Frank?
No, I don't.
It's fine.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
She never mentioned her father.
I don't know.
You must have been very proud.
I should be going anyway.
Of course.
Wow.
We know each other.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
I didn't sleep with him.
He was so pissed.
We were suite mates.
Oh God...
Stop.
Do we have to?
She's making this up.
How you holding up?
Good.  I'm good.
You are?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Well good.  So you're human.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Yep.
It's niiice.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Absolutely.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
You think he killed her?
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
Know what I think?
What?
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Someone's there.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
I don't...
Wow.  I'm losing it.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Sit down here.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
The planchette?
This.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
I don't know.
Nothing's happening.
Shhh.
Oh...
M-E...
Mef?  What's Mef?
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
I have to go.
Jody, wait.
Are you okay?
I think so
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
It's alright.
Does Norman know?
Jody, she's alive.
What?
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Did I?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Hartford?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
But Claire--
Okay.  Okay.
Oh God...you knew.
I was down in Adamant...
Adamant?
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Why?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Relieved?
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
All of us.
I'm a terrible friend.
No.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
What are you going to do?
If she was dangerous before--
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I know.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Like what?
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
What is it?
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Did he say that?
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
I don't know...
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
I think three...
Three weeks.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
She's awake.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Norman Spencer.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's today?
Yep.
Claire?
Three o'clock.
Whatcha reading?
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
How is it?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
Nice.  Almost done.
If you have to work...
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
How are you?
Fine.
It's okay if you're not.
I am, really.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Not the focus.
You know what I mean.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You are...
To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
We did.
I know.
Tired?
Nope.
Wanna fool around?
Shhh.
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Mmm.
Maybe we should just...
Tomorrow.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
I'll be there.
Did she say that?
More or less.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
Remember how we were?
Why?
To make sure she's all right.
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
That's not what I'm sug--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
But what if something happens?
Claire...
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
I know.
It's what I've been working for.
I just wish you could have heard her.
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
Promise?
Mmnph.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Is it gone?
Hi.
Oh.
Unless you need me to come home...
No, no.  It's fine.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
What are you doing here?
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
In the house.  I was scared.
Did you call the police?
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
Of course.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
What kind of whispering?
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Think I may have cracked it.
Really?
I think so.  Maybe.
You are so brilliant.
Yep.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
You're kidding.
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
Wow.
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, Doctor Spencer
Well, that's nice.
...especially Spencer's Theorem...
Oh, no...
...of Perpetual Distances.  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  I'm afraid you've mistaken me
That's...
I'm so sorry.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Did you tell her?
What?  No.  No.
You didn't?
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Huh.
Get down!  He'll see.
What's going on, Claire?
Shhhh.
He killed her.
What?
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
Our house.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
Where is she then?
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
See?
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
When?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Oh.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Tonight?
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
...Don't get all...
...like it never even happened...
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
Five minutes?
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
We're going to be fine.
There we go.
Well, that's a relief.
I don't need a shrink.
Harvey says he's amazing.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some symptom of something...
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
What are you doing out here?
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
This is the Feur thing?
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
How do you know this?
We had a seance.
Who did?
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
How did you--
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
What?
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Sabotage?
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
The accident...?
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Sweetheart--
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Keep your voice down.
I will NOT.
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
Claire, please...
I'm sorry...
Then where is she?
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Really big bed.
Do I have everything?
Call ya later.
What?
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
You know I am.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
I felt you...looking through me...
We walked all night...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
You dropped a glass.
I...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
What's wrong with me?
I may have seen her on campus.
Not personally.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
Yes.  The ghost.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
Stop...
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
STOP IT!
I take it your not mad at me.
Wouldn't go that far.
Ow!
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Since when?
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Who?
Your wife...
STOP IT!
You know...
What?
I've had enough good news for today
Claire--
Oh God...
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
So you fucked a student?!
That's not what I'm sayi--
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
Claire, please don't...
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
I never asked you to quit!
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
Who?
Leave her out of this!
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
I'm not going to listen to this.
I tried to break it off!
You should have tried harder.
Claire...
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
How did she know where it was?
We don't know that for sure.
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
It's alright.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
She's gone.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
The leaves...
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Look for antiques...
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
What?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Huh.
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
What's that for?
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
I don't believe you.
Mmmuh...
Shhhh.
Mauduh...
What?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
The one on the left - definitely...
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
I heard something like that
I'm sorry - I didn't think
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
When could I look round?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
So there is only one key...
And it can't be forged?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
All the time?
I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Yes - I have had it for years.
It doesn't mention 'females only'
I really don't know what to say
Sure...
Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?
The touch?
Do you take sugar?
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
What are you doing?
I'm sorry?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
I think I will pass...
Sugar?
Yes, one and a half please.
So what do you do?
And how long have you been a dentist?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Where do you kill them...
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
I don't know
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
No she didn't...
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them!
I don't want to talk about it -
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
I don't know...
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
I don't know...
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
How long have you been watching me?
I have something I have to show you...
then why did you marry her -
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
What didn't you like about her?
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
You've killed but you're not a killer
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Tell me how it happened...
Why should I?
Why not? Please - it would help me
And how did it feel to be rid of him
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
Did you?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
STEPHANIE?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
Then make it stop...
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
What's wrong?
Nothing could be better...
What's wrong?
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
What is it?
Open it...
Yes...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
Where are you going?
Out - I may be some time
We've got nothing to talk about
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
I am sorry...
Yes - I suppose so...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
No thanks -
First finish your tea...
He doesn't need to...
I don't like sugar
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
You killed my friend!
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
No - I'll have you after
At 2.00...
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
You heard me - keep away from him
Yes I can...
I want you out now
I'm your landlady
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
At home alone - where were you?
Get out...
I think you had better leave
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
No - a dentist
Just put it in my room
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Oh...
I thought it was you - how are you?
Yes, come on in...
That's good
Yes - of course.
Yes...?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
It's my wife.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Oh, yes you will...
Talk to me Artie.
This is insane.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
How you doing, Artie?
Eat a power bar.
Kelly.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I'd like that.
How soon can we get something?
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
What about the blood?
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
She still work there?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
And the child...
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
I know you do.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
He said something like, Do you want it dirty7 or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
He was large?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Then what?
He kept saying, Let it happen
You mean he withdrew...
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Try, Kelly.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
I'd like that.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
No.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Suzie Toller is missing.
Maybe she used another name.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
I don't know what to say...
You could tell me where you were last night.
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
Suzie?
I've got that two o'clock in town.
Back to the land of grownups.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
It's our job, Gloria.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
You saw the news today?
Lombardo's settlement?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Unless what?
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Eliminate the competition.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
I net a guy in a bar.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Guess I kind of lost it there.
You could say that.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
We all have...
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
You have someplace to be?
If you want company...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Where's the body?
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
We don't know that, Ray...
Will you do me one favor?
Ray, you heard him...
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
Where's Lombardo?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Why is that?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
About a year ago.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
So you were alone.
Yes.
Did he come in with you?
I guess.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
He did say something.
What was that?
He said, No little bitch can ever make me come.
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
You heard Kelly say Sam.  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
The teeth, were they...
Yeah... okay... he did
I wanna go home now.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
Apipoulai!
I suppose that means Hi ?
This wasn't my idea.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
Thank you, Jimmy.
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
Lombardo ever come out here?
I say something funny?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You are.
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
What brain?
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Shit.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Curiosity, I guess.
Excuse me?
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
You're out of your mind.
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
Police -- God -- get a life.
I'm not on your property!
Hi, Mon.
Which one of your bodyguards is that?
You notice my new jumper?
No thanks to you.
I miss Dad.
No you don't.
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Don't forget the car wash.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
In back of the garage.
So, where you off to now?
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Kelly...
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
How much?
About six and a half million dollars.
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
Do it to ourselves?
We have to stick with the plan.
Stick?
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
Yes.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Why can't you come...
You know what it takes.
Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
I'm here.
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Hello?
Hello.
God, I've been calling you.
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
Okay.  I love you too.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
That's not your line.
Say you love me.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
No little girl can ever make me come.
I'm running away.
You think that's wise?
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Good thinking.
Forget it.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Nellie Gail Ranch...
There's nothing for them to get.
I just want my life back...
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Just like that?
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Where is she?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
No.
Will they?
It doesn't look like it.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
You got something against cigarettes?
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
That's cop bullshit.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
About what?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
You, Kelly, Sam.
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Get away from me.
Shut up.
Davy.
That's right.  That was his name.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Sam, for godsake.
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
But she ran away.
That's right.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
Sit down, Lombardo.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
You mean this thing?
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Yeah, or get me drowned.
Jesus, man... You okay?
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Sam...
Put Kelly on too.
But I..
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Yeah, right.
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
Are you mad at me?
No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
That was about as grim as it gets.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
What?
What's wrong?
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
We?
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
How...
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
Hi, Sandy.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Sandy... What's up?
No.
Didn't you see her this morning?
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Uh..you're welcome.
Maybe milking.
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Sorry. It's important.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Just do it!
I thought I was the English.
Try the house.
It's been a while.
Pretty much.
Yes, sir.
Pick up the hat.
Who'd you see?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
No... I saw the man who killed him.
He was... like him.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
No pistol. Ever.
Tell you what Ã» I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Okay, Mr. Book.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
What's that, Sam?
Is it them?
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Are they going to kill you?
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
What are you going to do?
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Have you got your gun on now?
How reliable is this kid?
Amish.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight Ã» street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
You know who?
Maybe.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde Ã» what's-her-name Ã» come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Who else knows?
Just us.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
What's your first move?
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Who else knows?
Just us.
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in Ã»
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Move! Or you die right here!
Where are you taking us?
You have no right to keep us here.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
It's not a joke.
What was that?
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
Now what's the problem?
Whacking?
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
No you're not Ã»  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
They kid a lot.
I would not be too sure.
But not a good tired.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
No.
Oh? Anything else?
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
But why would they murder...
Because Ã» somehow Ã» they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Where are you taking us now?
Home.
You couldn't wait until morning?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
I can't.
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
No, no doctor...
But why?
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
But Ã»
Who are they?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Can I have something to drink?
How long?
How long have I been here?
Two days.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
But you can't.
Tell him his tea stinks.
You tell him. When you're able.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
Enjoying your reading?
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Hochmut?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Anything against zippers?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
No. I'd want a public phone.
I'm going this morning.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
The... bullets?
Oh. The bullets.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
We had some lemonade and he left.
You know carpentry?
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
What else can you do?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
But... You may not be well enough.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
When will you be going?
Not long... A few days.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
There was.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I know.
I was being foolish?
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
You're so sure of that?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's your way, not mine.
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Where's my baggy pants?
Here. Whenever you want them.
Anybody know about this?
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens Ã»
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
Listen to me Ã» Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
It's me.
I'm coming.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Make that 1790.
You know where he is.
You'd lie to protect him.
You admit you're lying?
You're the first one he'll contact.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him Ã»
But... if you had to guess?
Apipoulai!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes.
Good morning.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
Who was that man?
Looks dead...
That has no place in this house.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws Ã»
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I have committed no sin.
That is idle talk.
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
I am not a child.
You are acting like one!
I will be the judge of that.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
No, Rachel...
I have to help him!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I don't think she knows.
What about Carter?
Lean on him.
They don't have any shit.
All right, where is he?
No, you listen. Get out!
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
He'll live.
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
Get back in there.
My son is out there!
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
Is this where we're going?
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
No... No. It is just the English way.
I don't want to stay here.
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Love...
Yes! But love isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
What is... Make Love?
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, IÃ†ve heard them all.
What happened to Len Tashka?
CouldnÃ†t make it. Splitting headache.
He is an impostor.  ThereÃ†s no Davidov at Miratom.
HereÃ†s your imposter. HeÃ†s paid off the men on the plane outside.  TheyÃ†re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyÃ†re flying it wherever he tells them.
So who are you?
Bond --
They wonÃ†t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
With this?
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Alright then, brunch.
The plutonium is missing.  TheyÃ†ve taken the core!
Then itÃ†s no longer a bomb?
ItÃ†s a bomb alright. WeÃ†re still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
I did kill us. She thinks weÃ†re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
What the hell are you talking about?
ItÃ†s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Elektra King.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I was hoping you could tell me.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And MÃ†s life is part of the bet.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  HeÃ†s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subÃ†s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Made to look just like an accident.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Elektra would control it all.
Zukovsky...
If I donÃ†t get to the Boa before he gets to MaidenÃ†s Tower, M is dead.
Is there another way?
We go down to the torpedo bay.
HeÃ†s going to insert the plutonium.
Do you know what youÃ†re doing?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Just wanted to put him on edge...
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or weÃ†ll sink.
But what if...
Count to twenty.  IÃ†ll be there.
WeÃ†ve got to get out.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
ItÃ†s just a scratch.
I could come for a second opinion?
ConstructionÃ†s not exactly my line.
Old friend?
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. HeÃ†s a man of great integrity.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  IÃ†ve known that girl all her life. IÃ†m not sure she knows what sheÃ†s walking into.
SheÃ†s not a girl anymore.
IÃ†ve scheduled a medical for you.
ItÃ†s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
And now itÃ†s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
I took the initiative.
You havenÃ†t been given an assignment in this case.
I was the one who brought that money in...
IÃ†m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
ItÃ†s a message.  He wants us to know heÃ†s back.
Who?
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Renard.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, IÃ†d do the same again.
He survived?
The doctor who saved him couldnÃ†t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, heÃ†s a dead man.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Ã¦That which does not kill me makes me stronger.Ã†
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
HeÃ†s not through yet. Renard doesnÃ†t blow up five million dollars unless he knows thereÃ†s more coming in. HeÃ†s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnÃ†t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
The worm on the hook again.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
TheyÃ†re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I canÃ†t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
The inside man?
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Who did you get it from?
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
The name?
Indeed.
Revenge isnÃ†t so hard to fathom. WhatÃ†s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Who is it?
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Consider me ungrateful.
SheÃ†ll get over it.
HavenÃ†t you heard the news?  So is she.
Yes.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
You knew him well?
IÃ†m sorry.
Yes.
I havenÃ†t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Funerals arenÃ†t exactly memorable.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I donÃ†t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  IÃ†m not sure he knew that.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Partially, yes.
Who is he?
How long has he been with you?
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
Does this look familiar to you?
ItÃ†s my fatherÃ†s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
ItÃ†s not the pin your father wore. ItÃ†s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
If youÃ†ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I donÃ†t need a third...
The killer doesnÃ†t want to see this pipeline continue, doesnÃ†t want to see you take over...
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially KingÃ†s daughter.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
Oh my God...weÃ†re buried alive...
I canÃ†t stay here.
YouÃ†re not going to.
No!  It will cave in!
ItÃ†s the only way out...
I canÃ†t stay.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think IÃ†m a coward.
I think youÃ†re one of the bravest people IÃ†ve ever met.
What is it?
...you should rest.
James...
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
No. YouÃ†ll be safe here.
I donÃ†t want to be safe!
I have to go to work.
Vodka martini.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
What the hell are you doing here?
If this little show is for my benefit, IÃ†ll take you home right now.
You had your chance, James. Now IÃ†m looking for a bigger thrill.
I understand itÃ†s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Shush.
How did you survive?
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  IÃ†ve never told anyone that.
WhatÃ†s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
A little. Does it matter? After all, whatÃ†s the point of living if you canÃ†t feel alive?  IsnÃ†t that right, Elektra? IsnÃ†t that your motto?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
...what?
Are you saying...Renard is the man whoÃ†s trying to kill me?
You can drop the act, itÃ†s over.
I donÃ†t know what youÃ†re talking about!
I think you do.
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnÃ†t have to sleep with you to find that out.
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
You do what you have to do, but IÃ†ve called in M.  SheÃ†s en route from London even now.
I could have given you the world.
WhereÃ†s M?
Soon sheÃ†ll be everywhere.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Since I was a child, IÃ†ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnÃ†t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
You turned Renard.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
So you killed your father.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
Was this all about the oil?
It is my oil!  Mine and my familyÃ†s!
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
Elektra, itÃ†s not too late.  Eight million people neednÃ†t die.
One... last... screw?
Oh James.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
You, of course. I need some information.
Bond, IÃ†m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familyÃ†s, now itÃ†s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Have some of the ratÃ†s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
See?  YouÃ†re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
What?  This is not possible.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
SheÃ†s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
Really Bond, couldnÃ†t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
I thought you were the one in her business.
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
Now...where were we?
A rope!
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
And the payoff on the tables?
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
WhereÃ†s the sub going?!
No!  Get me out!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
Where?
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
The MaidenÃ†s Tower.
How appropriate.
IÃ†d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
What?
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
No! Bond!
Bond!
What is this place?
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
C-class.
IÃ†ll send someone out.
Could...could you come?
Perhaps this isnÃ†t the time...
Please.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnÃ†t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Your father...
Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyÃ†re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Someone will come.
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Of course...
What do you think?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
EverythingÃ†s under control up here.  Are you ready?
WeÃ†ve been pawns in someoneÃ†s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Do we have the range of RenardÃ†s plane?
The parcelÃ†s in the post.
Where it can do the most damage.
Any word from him?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Why?  What's the problem?
I would like to use the bathroom --
What?!
Don't call me that.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
A whore fucking.
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
God isn't there to do it.
Hi, Jon.
Hello, Adrian.
The bearer of bad news.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
What's your theory?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Blake?  Dead?
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
I could stay and go.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Jon, no -- I can't --
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
You -- you know about me and Dan?
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Because --
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this script you're following . . . who writes it?
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
You're the only human being I care for.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
I won't do that.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
What -- am I --
Itâ•£s very strange.  Timeâ•£s flowing backwards . . .
Jon -- what??
Jon, where are we?
Veidtâ•£s complex.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
No.  I just wanted you to --
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Good night.
Who?
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
The missing scientists.
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
What is it?  How does it work?
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Adrian -- you've lost it.
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there.
Donâ•£t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wonâ•£t even be here, will we?
Iâ•£m not.
What if youâ•£re wrong??
Then Iâ•£ve been a very bad boy and youâ•£ll have to spank me.  Christ!  Iâ•£m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
You're sure?
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
His what?
His . . . whatever.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
Play one.  Educate yourself.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
. . . What?
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
What is it.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Laurie --
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
You and me.
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
What are you up to?
Don't look.  Turn around.
Okay!
What the hell -- ?
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I know how to say Hello. Teach me how to say Good-bye, that's all I need.
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say make love?
Uh...
...Hoppi-hoppa.
What?
The costumes.  Am I right?
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
Yes you are.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
What's he doing?
I think he's going to the john.
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
What was he doing?
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Where did he go?
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Those cars.  What year is this??
Everything's changed --
Dan -- what do we do now?
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
So do I.  So do you.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
. . . That was quick.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
What new information?
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Coward.  Giving up.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
What happened?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What caused it?
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Adrian.  Itâ•£s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
No comment.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
I don't know their real names.
I don't know their real names!
Then why don't you ask him?!?
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Jon??  You mean he's --
Adrian.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
He's a little farther gone every time.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
What about you?
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
I'm sorry about Blake.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
New information.
Ever see one of these before?
What is that ungodly smell?
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Here we go again...
You get that off the screen?
You noticed..
Where you going?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
It's difficult.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
I'm so very sad.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Protect life... Until death.
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...The rain falls...
It's up to you now, Angel!
I'm so tired...
I want to sleep... forever...
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
Exactly.
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Why?... Why would you need me?
Tell me...
I love you...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
At least I won lunch.
Been here long?
We can't risk letting them in.
Careful.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
They'll be back.
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
You know where it is?
We'll meet in three hours?
Where is everyone?
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
But it's got teeth.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
With what just happened upstairs --
You gotta push the little yellow button...
You're welcome..
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Hey!
Easy.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
What tunnel? Where?
What's it for?
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
Follow me.
Where's the tunnel?
We just smeared a skunk.
Just move!
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Anyone else?
We're going to get help.
What?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
What's in the back?
But not flush against the tunnel?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Well...
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
The girl's got rhythm.
Sure.
How much I got, what?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
He only shot you once.
He shot you the other time.
Will these boards hold?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Good.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
What?
What?
Huh?
Nothing.
What's it for!?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Four door?
Two.
Open?
Covered.
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Keys.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
Fine, Chief.
NO, but I will lock you in.
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Move slow and move quiet.
Move it!
Shit!
If he doesn't shut up...
Hurry!
COME ON!
Get something on that.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Let's move.
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
YOU'LL HIT US!
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
Okay, well that's something.
That's fine.
Hold it!
Wait God-dammit!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Go!!!
Get to your cars!
Let's lock off this room.
All right.
You know you don't have to do this.
I admire your strength.
Right.
Her name is Charlie.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
We should stick together out there.
Welcome home.
Do you know how much I missed you?
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even hello
I'm not accusing you...
Okay, I believe you.
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
How's the detective business?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Honey, I'm not, please...
I love you.
I love you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I know.
Why the gun?
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Hello?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You should have.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
I don't know what to say
You're killing me...
Who are you calling?
Mrs. Christian.
What?
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Tom... she's dead.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
I just talked to her.
What are these?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
I'm telling you...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
Hmm.
You said something about money.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
That's five thousand dollars.
Is it?
And they are?
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Machine.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
We can do that.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Just my son and I.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Have you ever been there before?
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Machine's in?
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
I said new, this is an '90.
So do I just follow you?
So let's do it.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
Have you forgotten about your sister?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
What about Kate?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to go for it. I need your cover. Cover my ass.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Thank you, son.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Where's that?
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
What's your name?
Jacob.
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
What's this about, money?
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
Where are the keys to the motor home?
On the dresser.
Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
Not a chance.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Sorry, I need everybody.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
Yes.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
Scott and Kate.
My wife.
Where is the little lady?
In heaven.
She's dead?
Yes, she is.
How'd she die?
Auto wreck.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes, they do.
Is this real?
Yes.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Real McCoy.
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
Why'd ya quit?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Yes.
Didn't like it, did ya?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
You won't let him touch her?
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
You brought the money?
Right here.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
You best better get it done, Pops.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
I don't have the slightest idea.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
Then?
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Who else?
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
Why are you so agitated?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
He backed down.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', Fuck you Jack. I hear that loud and clear.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
What did you call me?
To your family.
To yours.
Now, is your shit together?
Forever together.
Where are the women?
They should be here any minute.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
In the Winnebago.
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
Did he...?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
What's this stuff?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
Amen.
I promise.
Kate, Scott?
It's the bitterest of pills.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
That happens, you'll get it back.
What do you think Mom would say?
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Sure.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It's a flop house.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
About two hours from now.
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Scott?
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Not good enough, swear to God.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
No!
Everybody goes home!
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
Sure.
What?
What's in Mexico?
Mexicans.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
What are you... ?
Take out your gun!
Do what?
What you said to me in the room.
What did I say?
You asked me if I would --
Creepy guy.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yes.
Do you believe me?
Yes.
You damn well better. Go.
Yeah.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Yeah, we got a bible.
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
You're gonna let us go?
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Okay.
Are you okay?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
I'm really sorry.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
We have to go back for Daddy!
Daddy's dead.
Noooo!
Watch my back!
Anytime.
How many bullets left, kid?
Not many.
Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Look, I don't know what this...
Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
Later.
-- you got your shower --
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to Benny's World of Blood.
I remember him.
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
You callin' him a liar?
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
What dya mean?
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
What the fuck was that about?
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
Start the car.
You believe me don't cha?
Shut up and start the car.
Richie? You okay?
Yeah?
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
One... Two... Three.
Friend of yours?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
He didn't recognize shit.
Do they have cable?
No.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
Feels good.
I'm gonna go get the money.
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word barter.  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
All I'm saying --
this conversation is over.
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Sight seein'.
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
How do you know?
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
Where's the woman?
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
She's in the other room.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Seth, if you were me --
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes.
Richard!
This isn't gonna work.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
They're gonna search the van.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
What does that mean?
What?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
This ain't the time, Richard.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Keep your voice down.
Or what?
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
This ain't the time.
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I don't know, you just passed out.
I did?
Really?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
What?
We are...  South of the border down Mexico way.
We are?
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
That's what you look like.
You're lookin' green.
How?
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
I'm here with you.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
It don't look together.
Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
Yeah.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
How are you?
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
He needs our help!
You're a dead man.
Leave him alone.
... sorry...
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
You betrayed us.
Call me Tom.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Any good?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
Who is this.
What the fuck are you.. ?
What's he talking about?
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Fuck you!
Starting to recognize a pattern?
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Big bites.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Who the hell are all these people?
What?
Me!? You where the one...
I like that image.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
It was a lot of fucking money.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Well, I can be tough if I want.
That why you dumped him?
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
Nearly four years...
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
He stole my report! That's my report!
We know, Audrey.
You okay?
You made a mistake.
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Animal, I can't.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Something like that.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Think we can fit up in there?
Only one way to find out.
He's not going to do it.
Oh yes he will.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
The JFK? In the rain!?
But we can get to the west side faster.
No.
You must have quite some harem.
Why?
Because we're going there.
Yeah, well...
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Sure. I'd like that.
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
And you think this creature is one of them?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
What else do you know about it?
Are you sure?
Nesting?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
You never said it was off the record.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
Nobody saw you bring her in?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Show me.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Oh my God! They're coming!
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
My life sucks.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
Nick Tatopoulos.
Keep moving.
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
That's the problem. He did.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Wish me luck!
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
Can I use some?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
You're kidding, right?
Did you talk with Humphries?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
Mr. Caiman...
I can't.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
You don't understand, I can get us information...
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Where?  Show me where.
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Do it.
Don't think I won't.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you felt like it.  Almost makes you worse.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Fuck you!
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
I'm listening.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You are a private investigator?
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
I was well compensated.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Never mind how I found you.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Shut up.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You're asking me why?
I'm asking.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
You almost went over your limit.
Fuck you.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Yeah... guess so.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Pardon me?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
I'll risk it.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Truman Capote.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Remember me?
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
Good for you.
How long you been working there?
Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
I'm not a cop.
Not quite.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much?
How much do you make now?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me pops.
... Hello... ?
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Interesting theory.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Child pornography.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
What about me?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A daughter.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Specialty product.
You're learning.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
See ya.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Great.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Wha... ?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Who is he, his name?
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself Machine
You don't need to be here.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be Choke
Devil frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
What's next?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Nope.
What's this?
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Uh huh, pleasure.
Thank you.
He's odd.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
He succeeded.
What is this?
I reserved a Cadillac.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
You see that? The way the man just went right over?
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
So where's the money?
I guess still in the locker.
I mean I don't care.
You see the paper?
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Who?
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
Come here, Farrah...
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
Farrah. Come here.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
What about him?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
You get the money?
Trade for what?
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
You get life for kidnapping.
Calm down, Bear...
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
And that's for the airport.
We'll get it later.
You're right.
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
So you didn't have the key with you.
I'm afraid I don't...
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Not too bad.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
So... how many movies you been in?
About sixty.
Your who?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
He's around someplace.
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
What's this movie you're doing first?
Harry, let me answer that.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
You can talk to me.
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a snuff film.  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
That's right, me.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie Fingers.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
There's Ilona.
What about her?
Get something going there.
She's... young.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
Who?
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
You know how to write one of these?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
That's all there is to it, huh?
That's all.
I really think I can be of service on this one.
I need the money.
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Tell you what...
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
Three.
Karen? You okay?
She can't talk right now.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
I'll find it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Gimme an hour.
Where's Karen?
In the can. That the money?
She's great. Gimme the money.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
What?
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
It's a different kind of deal.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people Ã»-
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
You... you need to go to the police.
You don't have any other choice.
It won't work like that.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
You serious?
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Leo, I don't know.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
The airport.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
I don't know.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
That's the magic number.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Nothing remotely like this.
Ray Barboni?
Who is this?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
What three hundred grand?
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Hello? You there?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Okay. So who are you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Never heard of him.
Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Or else what?
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Ray. Look at me.
You say look at you?
How'd you get in here?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Why would I do that?
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Yeah? Which terminal?
Sovereign.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I like it here.
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -Ã» I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -Ã» forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Whatever you want, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Okay...
I'm not positive this means anything.
He owes me money.
I don't like waiting.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
That's right.
I'm in the movie business.
I'm a producer.
Not yet. I just started.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Leo spanked a waitress?
What've you got?
Where you been, Harry?
Have we met? I don't recall.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
I'm looking at you.
That's what I'm doing.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
I know what a marker is.
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I want you to.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
You make movies, huh?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
You just did.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
Keep going.
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
So he comes to L.A...
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
Part of it, yeah.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
But you work for the casino?
So you don't work for the casino?
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
They always paid.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Ever shot anybody.
Once.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -Ã» this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer Ã»-
Harry, look at me.
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
For a movie?
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my Driving Miss Daisy.
What's it called?
Mr. Lovejoy? That's the title?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
One of his best parts.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Ride the Clouds. Good picture.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
So what's the problem?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
He drown?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -Ã»
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Just a thought.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
Read it. It's a grabber.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
You're kidding, right?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell 'em something.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
His shrink's trainer.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
Get the fuck outta my chair.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
You have it?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Who?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
He died.
Yeah, he told me.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
It was in the Herald.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
Twenty seven hundred.
Yeah. That was a good party.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
We talk different?
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One we're producing.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Martin, look at me.
I'm looking at you.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Like this?
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
Wait. How about this?
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
How about this?
That's not bad.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I believe it.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
How do I know that?
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Okay. I'm listening.
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Buddy?
Very nice...
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
What's that?
Compass.
Whatta you think, Chill?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
You've been losing.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
Here's another tip...
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
Sit down, Leo.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I'll find you, Leo...
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
The door from the patio, in back.
You broke in?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
What if it was?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
That's right. Three percent.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
A real bargain.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
How much is the wife offered?
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
What're you doing here?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Rough day on the set?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons Ã»-
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
...That's what we finally decided.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in Mildred Pierce -Ã» which by the way was a better book than a movie -Ã» did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
For any movie.
Man, can you scream.
Cotton.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
He must mean after Slime Creature 3.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Don't go out of your way.
Right. See how your story ends.
You been here the whole time?
That's exactly what I am.
I got you a copy of the script.
What do you think?
I think it's not horrible.
Then you've read it?
Not yet.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
There a part in it for you?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Sounds fair.
What do you get out of it?
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
Depends, who pays?
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Really.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You thought I was faking?
Oh.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -Ã»
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
Harry... My God...
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You sure?
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I'll go. I'll go.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
She just seemed... depressed... ?
What was she running from?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
Why do you think he did it?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
I didn't mean to...
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
You bet.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Go get your stuff.
What took you so long?
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
That's what the guy said.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
I told you not to -Ã»
Don't say a fuckin' word.
Of course.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
Pick 'n' Save.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
Hello, Doris.
Come on in.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
How honorable of you.
What's wrong?
Be quiet and listen.
I don't hear anything.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry -Ã»
How did you get in the house?
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
That's where you got the idea?
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
'We?'
Chili and me.
We're all like that.
No.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Mob guy?
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Shylock?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Hello, Martin.
Really.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Oh, for Christ's sake Ã»-
Lufkin. His... agent.
But you are interested?
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Thanks.
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
Do you think the police did a good job?
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
Passenger vessel Chimera. I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
With that coxswain dickhead.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
You think the extra strain caused it?
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
How about now?
Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
Lemme see.
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Fucker!
Damn mind of it's own.
Morning, skipper.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
What's so great about Sweden?
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Let's not be too hasty.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
What day is it?
I don't know. Tuesday?
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Why not.
What is your first name?
Maureen.
What?
Maureen.
Maureen?
Roger?
Yeah.
You think that's funny
No.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
It's been six years.
Bring it on, dude.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Or uninvited guests.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
What other choices have we got?
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
Guess I'll just keep working.
What're you crazy?
I like my job.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Maybe that is his boat.
Gimme a break.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
So we kill him?
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Oh yeah.
A what?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
Then what the hell happened to him?
Try Wednesday.
Right. Wednesday.
Did you?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Why not?
Dodge.  Dodge.
What?
Get up.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
If you get it back in one piece.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
Sounds reasonable.
Mother fucker!
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
How long to fix?
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
What's this?
Turbine rotor's shot.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
Hard to say.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
What about running number two by itself?
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
How long, then?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
How long?
Three, four days.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
Went aboard.
She take a radio?
It's a hell of a lot of money.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Or somebody stopped them.
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
How about you Epps?
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
Yeah, yeah.
Sounds like the hull.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Not in the eyes of the law.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Why not? Why the fuck not?
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
Bodies're too fresh.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
Could be meant as a warning.
That'd be my guess.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Can't you use something else?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Right.
Dodge to Murphy.
Murphy.
What is it?
I think you better see this for yourself.
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
Not me.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
How do you mean?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
What do you propose?
For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I don't know what you're talking about?
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio!
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
You smashed it!
Don't lie to me!
What the fuck -- ?
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
Conveniently enough for you.
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
What the hell happened!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
If money can buy what he wants.
Then you're a lucky man.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Right.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
There's a charming thought.
What is this?
Her belongings?
You're late.
Don't fall asleep.
Right.
What's slow?
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
I bet you did.
Could be a fishing boat.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
Hell yeah.
That's a good thing?
What'd he look like?
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
I'll do what I can.
Because of the gold.
Any dizziness?
I feel fine.
Better than starving to death.
What?
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Candy?
Go on.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Coffee?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
No, sir, he is not.
What'd you find up there?
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
She was sailing up north, right?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Nope.
So what did happen?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
Only way to be.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
Why not call for help?
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Did you see him?
Who?
The guy. He just came this way.
What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
You sure it wasn't me?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
No cowboy shit. Right.
Got your light?
Yup.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Murphy to Epps.
Epps.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
Greer?
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
He needs a doctor.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
How's he doing?
Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
The ah... the radio's out.
What?
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
But, who -- ?
The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill.
February first.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made.
Collision? With what?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
But where's the damage?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
If it was a ship she hit.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Cash.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
It's not gonna hold us.
Doesn't matter.
Hey.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
Wish I could say the same.
What do you think happened on this boat?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
The what?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Not our mystery guest again.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
What, like some kind of ghost?
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Showing you what?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Victims of what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know.
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
Just lucky I guess.
Epps, over.
Either of you seen Dodge?
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Epps? You there?
Right here.
What do we do with him?
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
What do you think?
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. Like wild dogs.
Over the gold.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
What happened?
We hit land.
What?
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
So you killed them?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Greer to Murphy.
Go.
Of course they did.
Let the buyer beware.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
Better than making hamburger for Mickey D.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Yeah.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Alright. I'll be right up.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
It's funny.
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Murphy, goddamit.
Sorry.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
We've done it before.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
I don't want to.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
Morning.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Ho, baby!
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
I heard that.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
What now?
We could call for help.
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Greer?
Moving to Sweden.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Pretty low all around.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
And look what happened.
Maybe.
Lost my sea legs.
What happened?
You've been out for about a day.
Say what?
Oh, man.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
Rick...I can't.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
Shut up.
It's a Noaa buoy.
A what?
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
We're still drifting.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
He took the shotgun and a light.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Can't find the shotgun.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
What about the gold?
Leave it.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
Fine with me.
What's wrong?
What?
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
Better late than never.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Fifteen, at the most.
You're kidding, right?
Kristen...
It was bad.
I can't find him.

Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Forget it.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
Yeah, right.
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
No.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Why?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Yeah, right...
Then why do you hate me so much?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Oh, hi...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Okay... I promise.
Hi Enid.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
What?
Why?
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Okay, okay!
Authentic 50's diner? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Hi, Al!
You loser!
What does that even mean?
You can have that one.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
What is this?
Hey - why do you have this?
I've been looking all over for this.
Look, that's back when I hated you.
I remember every minute of that party.
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
I want to do him!
Which loser?
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Do you think he knows?
I dunno...
Totally! Look!
He's insane!
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
Not really...
What, is she black now?
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
What are you talking about?
Why don't you ask him.
JOSH!
Should we leave a note?
Everybody's too stupid!
Ew ... when did you get that?
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
Anthony's II!
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Like what?
He gives me a total boner!
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Get away from me!
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
God, you're really obsessed...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Don't you want nice stuff?
You're insane.
What happened to Seymour?
How repulsive!
Why? What did he say?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
I said great...
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
So, whaddya think?
So where's all your stuff?
That's all you're bringing?
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Maybe an orange juice.
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid.
Well, we won't keep you.
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Indian records?
Is this one any good?
A dollar seventy-five.
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah, sure, I guess...
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
I really didn't get a good look at her.
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
I - I'd really rather not...
Shh!
C'mon, Seymour, please?
Relax, Seymour, relax...
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Yes, that would certainly do...
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
What did you tell that girl?
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
No, Doofus... blow it out!
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
That's the spirit!
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
Oh, hi...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
No, of course not.
What about this?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
Yeah, well I like you too...
What?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I dunno, I...
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What do you want?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
Talk to us about it...
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
She's not at home?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
What are you talking about?
How much?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Janosz?
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Good night, Janosz.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
We don't have a relationship.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Hello, Peter.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
His name is Oscar.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
I'll do it.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I don't know what to do anymore.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Now you're talking.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Ghostbusters.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
Should we go?
Too bad for the Moldavians.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
My pleasure.
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
The Upper West Side.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
I knew that.
That's it?  I'll be back?
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, Death is but a door
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
Is the line sinking?
Rivers of the stuff!
So, no goat hooves, huh?
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Like a goat on garbage.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
She's new in town.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
You got a flux and a half.
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
No, I just thought --
Are you all right?
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
And decent.
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
I'm on it
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
No.
I'd love some.
Aren't you eating?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Will you take me home now?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
What is the matter?
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Yes.
With a family?
And it's all over now.
Okay.
You sure you really want to?
You do?
Benjamin -- I really do.
What's the matter?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Because I want to know what's happening.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Elaine --
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Here? In Berkeley?
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
I want to ask you a question.
Because -- I am.
Is it because I'm here?
What do you think?
All right then! Yes!
I don't understand --
Please let me go.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
Don't tell me --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Goodbye.
You won't?
I don't know.
But you might.
Yes.
We just can.
We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Thank you.
Yes I am.
Exactly how do you mean?
Yes, I will.
Not exactly.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Oh -- no sir.
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
What did you do to her?
Could I make one phone call first?
Well here's the purse.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Right.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
What?
Can I help you, sir!
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
What?
Where is your luggage?
Sir?
How are you, Benjamin?
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
Is what a girl?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
Let's go.
Thank you.
What?
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
Why not?
I don't know.
No.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
I'm very neurotic.
What do you think of me?
What do you mean?
What?
So?
Sit down.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
No.
Benjamin?
Yes?
Won't you unzip my dress?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Thank you.
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Why is it?
Oh my God.
Do you understand what I said?
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Very well. Thank you.
He didn't see me.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Why don't you get it.
Benjamin.
To tell you?
What?
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
What?
What?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Are you afraid of me?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
If you want.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Anything. Anything at all.
Oh my God.
You're not interested in art?
Do you really want me to?
I got up.
How'd you do it?
Get her to act like a human
What?
Always?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
Well how long has this been going on.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Man, is this interesting.
Not exactly.
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
Well I can't.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Was he a law student at the time?
Kind of.
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Oh my God.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Good.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Benjamin?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
You're not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
I see.
Now don't start this.
Don't start acting hurt.
What are you doing?
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Thank you.
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
This is absurd.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Do exactly what I say.
Now it seems to me --
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
What have you done to her?
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I'll find her.
When I go off?
Nothing else.
Oh, no.
Why did you say that?
No wait. Wait.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Well, wait.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
They don't know?
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Well --
I guess -- about my future.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Yes, sir.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Quite a while.
Yes, sir.
Oh yes.
I will.
Great.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
Hello.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Yes.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Hello.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
The Carlsons' are here.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Are you lost?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Hm?
It's a bitch.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
No.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least we found the diamonds.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
You know what gets me?
Go home!
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Go home.
I'm liable to find anything!
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
How about breakfast, wife?
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
Huh.
You told me.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
I dunno.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
Okay.  Okay.
If what?
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
How are you, honeybunch?
Is Penelope in?
You've come to the right man.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Insurance!
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
That can be arranged.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
Out!
You were about to ask a question?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Dr. Woodly.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
No.
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
England?
Oh hell.
As in Death
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Wow.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Mhravitch.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Go on.
You're supposed to get hurt!
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Scat!
Can I get dressed first?
Dad--
What kind of exercise?
I'm a man.
Mom?
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
I don't want to fight you.
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
Hamburger Heaven.
Heaven.
How do you do?
Like hugging a lamp post.
Situation.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
We thought a doctor might help.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Have some.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
A trip, you mean?
I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
Now--turn around, if you would.
Turn around?
I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
I have some change!
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
People don't use that word any more.
No.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
Yes.
Why not?
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Did you like it, dear?
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He knows you shattered his violin.
Hope.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
I see.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
You hope this, too?
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Block E?
Help your mother find the bullet.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
You've killed women?
Ooops.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Oh dear.
We'll miss you so.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And her fiancÚ!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
I came back.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks.
There's a certain amount of information there.
What brought you back?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Get up.
And you went home unannounced, too?
There was so much going on.
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
Don't!
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
What a relief!
I don't want to live any more.
The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
That's an interesting piece of news.
Not true.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I didn't know that.
No.
Then who flushed the toilet?
That man is your father.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
What are his symptoms?
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I'm glad.
I know.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
Yeah.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
What's the matter now?
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
It is?
The only thing I ever told him about life was, Keep out of the park after the sun goes down.
Paul's only twelve years old.
He's not your son.
I believe in miracles now.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
You've got to fight from time to time.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
Kid--kid--
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
But there is a family resemblance.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
A block of ice.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Do you dance?
Do you sing and dance?
Your hearse?
Yearse!
Oh.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
It's very interesting.
No.
Sort of.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
All right.
Promise?
How about some ginger pie?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so tall and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
What happened?
Look.
But what?
Why not?
But this is public property.
Is he all right?
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
What were you fighting for?
No more revolts.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
But I don't play anything.
Okay?
I think he's following us.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
The ice is melting.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
I like you, Maude.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
What is it, Harold?
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Just like this.
She took my head.
You sure have a way with people.
Yes. They're old friends.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Farewell?
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Well, not dying, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
I have a sore throat.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
At a funeral.
I don't care what people say.
Perhaps it is.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
Ah, yes.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
No.
Well, maybe one.
No.
Yes.
You liked your teachers?
Your studies?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
You think so, sir?
To pit your own life against another.
The moment of truth.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Well, I don't...
Harold! That's disgusting!
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Stay where you are, Harold .
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
William didn't even go to high school
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is Don't Drive Drunk. I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Our customers? You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Ha.
How do you know about that?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
My band.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
You're not even coming?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
What's up?
No way.
What the fuck is that?
So?  You even said they're good.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells I Just Called To Say I Loved You? Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
It's the new --
Oh well.  Nevermind.
Don't do it, Rob!
Hey, Barry.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Oh.  Okay.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Well if one of them is this Sin City thing --
Fine.  That's great.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Yeah.
What's his name?
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like the Upsetter by Lee Scratch Perry, in there.  Instead of Sin City.
Okay. Dance Music For Old People?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Yeah, sure...
Hey Charlie.
Huh?
Can I help you?
I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Can I help you?
What needs sorting out?
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Hi.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
And do you like it that way?
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
I think you know that.
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
You won't like it.
Will you please just go?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? Motel Matches? I Want You? I Hope You're Happy Now? Green Shirt? His records should be sealed in cases that say in case of vicious betrayal
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
It's me.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
That bad, eh?
You know what I mean.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Mmm hmm.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Hey, how ya doin'?
Pig died.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Look, we can do other things.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
What about Ian?
Want to know what, exactly?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
Nothing.
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Not really.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
So?
What's happenin'.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be. You know?
What's the -- hey, Liz --
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Good.
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
It's a great song.
Yup.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Nor have you!
Are you okay?
Whiskey.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
So you'll stay?
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
Who is it?
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
The poem?... The poem was great!
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
The Criminal Courts Building.
Hildy!
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Oh, she was here.
Did you give her the money?
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Yes!
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
No. My mother.
Just for the first year.
Anything the matter?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
The money? Why?
Call Duffy!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
Save that for the Tribune.
How long is what?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Done what?
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
What?!!
No, I can't.
You bet I've got a better offer.
I know, Walter, but I --
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Where'd you meet this man?
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
No kidding?
What for?
Oh, I'm sorry.
What do you mean?
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
We're not interested.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
I get it!
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Hildy!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
How much do you want on it?
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
All right, Walter.
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Where's Bruce?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
Finished!
What did you do with her?
What happened?
You been in a fight?
Where is she? Tell me!
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Ring that number, will you?
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
Murder, uh?
When did you deliver this first?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
In a way.
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Hildy!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
You're not fooling anybody.
How about Bruce's?
Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth.
Hildy, darling!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
What?
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.
There's money in it, Cooley.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
Hey!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
What have you got, Hildy?
Call you back.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Hold the phone!
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
He's harmless.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
If there was any way out...
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
Pure politics!
Now what do you say?
Shoot to kill, I said.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
I won't.
Where's the old lady?
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Where's the money?
Here!
That's good.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
Mother!
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
I won't, Earl.
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Don't move!
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Keep away!
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Wait a minute, Mollie.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
Why not?
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
You're insane!
Hello, Mollie.
Pick you up Friday, then
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Gabrielle.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Like father, like son.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Oui. Perfect!
Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
That would be good.
Shall we close up, then?
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
You are sweet.
What is wrong, my darling?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Not in front of the boy.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
But?... But? There is a but
Urgh.
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
I've got some things to tell you.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
God, you're beautiful.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
Oui.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
No.
My apologies, madam.
But I like being human now.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Ouch. Yeah?
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Really?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Oh, Rosie.
You've got to respect that.
Where?
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
Paper or cloth?
Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world.
It looks wonderful.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
My God! The fork! The fork!
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
That's a great idea.
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Terrific. Can't wait!
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Yes.
We could call it Quit Bugging Me
That's very funny.
A deer?
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
What are you doing in there?
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
You are an animal.
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
No.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Sure. Of course.
That's great.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Have you?
Bravo to you, Puff!
Absolutely!
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Ummm. It's good.
You were gone a long time.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Unn.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Yes.
hey.  Great show, huh?
Why, don't you?
I'm fine. I'm
My name is AL.
I'm...inside you.
It wasn't him.
Me.
Yeah?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
What are you doing?
You're not crazy.
I'll talk to them.
What's that?
Calm Down! Act rational.
No. Don't tell the guards.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I am. You are.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
I'm not gonna make it easy.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
What does it say.
Take a left and your next right.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
You are in trouble. Now do it.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
Just get there.
What is it?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
What? What do you mean?
What was?
What's happening?
Where are you going?
Is something glinting?
It is my business. It's my name.
What did that cost?
He recognises you, throw him off.
She's the toughest to read.
You're doing great with her.
Oh come on.
And on my time.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
Bingo.
Run, stupid!
That's not funny.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
You have to! Quickly!
Not sure at all.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
Do it.
I told you
You don't care if I die
Why?
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
What exactly?
Never mind that, where are we now.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She is beautiful.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
You just got a Mickey.
Sorry...
Good.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Who?
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be cool?  You don't think I can be laid back like everyone else?
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
She said penetrate. Heh heh heh.
After you, Doll.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
What a touching story.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
I don't need it.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
I assume this is on Rex?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
And you've always loved him?
He'll regret this.
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
Oh, for the love of...
Absolutely.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
So I hear. Is that all?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Miles?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
No. Don't stop.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
She didn't love you?
No, we're not!
No.
Why'd you lie?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
I don't have a ring!
I know.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Hello Marylin.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with the criminal mind.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Hello?
Marylin?
No buts. Now. Out.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
You were going to have this thug...?
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Forgery? Fraud?
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked what was my daddy like?
Sweet.
Forgery and Fraud?
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
So. Now what?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Wow.
Of Massey Myerson?
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
I wish I had your discipline.
He has a reputation for being tough.
I'm dying.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
What?
So what?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into; professionally speaking.
Yes?
Excuse me?
What?!
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the knock-out
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
Berry spoons.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
the coin?
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Muriel Rumsey.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
I found a million dollar babyù
Yeah.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miamiù  for the love of it?
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified inù
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized.
And this is what you wantùthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
What ten thousand?
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselfùlong ago.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Becauseù
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
South America.
I'll get it annulled.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itùif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmùmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
What've you got against King Westley?
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Oh, no.
On the road.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
I'm sorry you read it.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementùthat you've had a talk with meùthat we've reached an understandingùthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married toù  ùas long as I can get her back.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
What happened to your money?
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
I beg your pardon!
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
What happened?
What am I going to do now?
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything thatù
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
You must have me confused withù
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it.
Of course I do. What do you meanù
That's none of your business.
Now, just a minuteùyou can'tù
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doùleap for joy?
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Not at all.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Listen, BratùI'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Outside!
I'll find it myself.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Egg. One eggùdoughnutsùblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Yeah?
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. IùI did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
KingùKing Westley was in it.
Thanks, professor.
Detectives!
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
After that The Three Musketeers.  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
I don't trust that chatterbox.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Of course it is.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
You're prejudiced.
What's got into you?
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
knowùbutù
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Hitch-hiking.
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hikingù
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Carrots.
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the Hitch-Hikers Hail.
Amazing.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carùand I won't use my thumb.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Me?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Same to you.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Well, I am.
You sound like a hobo.
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itùthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
SorryùI didn't mean toù
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
Heyùyou not up yet? Come onùcome on!
What's up?
Yeah.
Wait a minute, GordonùIù
Get out!
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
For heaven's sake, Joeùstop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Okay, pete.
Hey, you!
I'd like to sit with myùuhùwifeùif you don't mind.
What's up?
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeùandù
Orange, New Jersey.
SureùsureùI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Te...!
Ted, what's wrong?
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Elaine.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
What are you doing, Ted?
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Wholesome.
Then you do think I'm insane.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I'd use the word insane.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Not now, Elaine.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Simon just ejected!
That's right -- premature ejection.
Are you afraid?
Set!
Compute!
What can I do, Doctor Rumack?
I mean for Ted.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Women and the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Can't we change course?
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Intermitant failure in scan mode R. Analyze.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
I dazzled him with my wit
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Acting the way we do.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
So, what do you think we should do?
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Or something.
What's up?
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
I totally heard you did.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You're being really immature.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Huh?
Why?
You know it's okay.
Okay.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What is your job title, exactly?
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Hon, did you get expelled?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
I know enough.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Commercials.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
We definitely want it to have junk.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
That suits you.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Hello?
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Go learn something.
Nope. We're safe.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
Most Fruitful Yuki? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
What?
Oh, okay. Like this.
No?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
But you're old!
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
This is the baby. Your baby.
No...
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Elbow.
Juno MacGuff.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
Who is the kid?
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
The duck?
I know the porn career's a lie.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Yeah, she does.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
I am a suicide risk.
Is this Juno?
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as wholesome. I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
A hospital? What is it?
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Touche.
Aw, please Junebug?
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
No way! She's pretty.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Hot!
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Juno, what's the matter?
What?
What are you referring to?
A hotel?
Well...
I hate peas.
What?
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
What's the matter?
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
No what?
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Uh-huh.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
My grandmother's .
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
It wasn't like that.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
How many, would you say?
You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
You're hitting on me?
He chose them already?
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
That's terrible!
Is she?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
You know her?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
It's not my alibi to tell --
You're pawning The Rock?!
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
Margot!
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
Neat.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Aside from that.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
No, she can't move for an hour.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
So?
The what?
I can't.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
What the hell is that for?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
For a butt-head? Yes.
So now you're -- ?
Oh, my God!!
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Because I like to torture you.
What?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
I guess it'll have to...
Of course.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
That's not entirely --
No.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
Uh -- sure.
Do anything exciting?
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Thank you. Having fun?
Well, yeah, but --
I gave her my word, Warner.
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Are you serious?
Why do you say that?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
No, Daddy.
When I go?
Now will you get in the flask?
I'll call her later.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Try an angel.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says hi.
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Well, let's rock and roll.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Now you're talking.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Definitely.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
This is bad, Nicky.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
Coulda been much worse.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
You smell like coconuts.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
If you want to.
Octopus people?
It's freezing my hands.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
Hey.
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
...The Devil?...
Don't do it.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
I love you.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Off limits.
Yes. I would like my flask back.
Tempestuous?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah...
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Mrs. Edelson?
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
Are you sure you don't?
What are you doing?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
They went right to the President.
No...
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Yeah.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Bullshit.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Honey?
You talk to Max today?
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I want you to quit.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
There's no touching.
Well, you look it. You win?
What's up? Jess ready?
You driving her?
Yeah.
Shit.
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
What's that?
Yeah.
Brooklyn.
He must have that shit troughed.
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Ricky's taken care of.
You like the ponies?
Sure. Yeah.
This one?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
I didn't say that.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
You told him you liked him.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Where's the drop?
Nah.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Yeah.
Yeah?
We're with Ruiz.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
What about it?
So?
It's not losing record.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Don't be shitty.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
Bye.
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Seat belt.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
It's ours.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
C'mon, man...
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Forty-six.
Great. On my fucking room.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Well, I don't want to walk.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
Fuck...
I told you what they said.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
What the fuck is that supposed --
So is this the drop?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
So we're working?
Back in.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
What the fuck's going on?
We're not getting whacked.
You want us strapped, don't you?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
All the more reason.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Eighty bucks?!?
Calm down.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
You want to come splash around.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Cardiff Giant?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
The videos.
Drinks are free, right?
Where do you live?
Where do you live?
Don't drag my ass into this --
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
You really in trouble?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
No shit?
You want another drink?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
Coke?
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Ricky.
Is it nice?
Yeah.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Yeah.
Yes.
I get it.
So tell me how it is.
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
Goodbye.
He has a cute what...?
Scotland.
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
What are you going to do with him?
Where?
Epidural hematoma?
There's only one way.
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
And it's the ninth inning.
Y'all just act natural.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
Never heard of him.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
Gimme three.
You betcher ass, General.
I think I heard about that.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
Radar!
What for?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
I like an olive.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
What do we do?
They're coming.
He only lasted one season.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
What's the matter?
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
Why can't you look at him?
What's the story?
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
How much time do I have?
That. It's out of the act.
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
I don't think so either.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Yeah?
Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Yeah, maybe.
Are you all right?
Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
Action?
Um-hum.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Against what?
Oh. Yeah.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Me?
No, thank you.
Ted Sheldon.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
Yes, I did, John. But IùI had no idea what was going on.
How do you do.
Yes, sir.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellùI don't quite know what to say . . .
Mr. D. B. Norton!
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
What's that?
There is no letter.
I can read. I can read!
Sorry.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Right here. Sit down.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thatùeating a sandwichùand with a beard!
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Now listen, Annùhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
What do you do when you work?
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
Beany!
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
What do they want?
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Hey, Boss.
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Who's got him?
Ba-ll!
St-rike!
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Hello, Mr. Connell.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfùI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonùand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Yeah, you bet!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life. Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearùand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
What's your name?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Flowers.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
They're not usually graduate students.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
You're gettin' the car.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Anything on Korda so far?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Yeah.
Only at the very end.
It rarely has to be done.
What's the point of this?
National Marksman Competition.
Is there something wrong with that?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Where did you hear that?
You think you can learn, McCall?
It'll come. Try again.
Tell me what you need.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Get good at it.
What's the first commandment?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Why?
What did you see?
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
To run last?
We lost.
We won.
Damnit!
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
That it is.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
McCall, you all right?
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
I've proved that, didn't I?
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
If you did, you never showed it.
Mmm, needs a little something.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's okay. We broke up.
When?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
There is?
Korda escaped.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Scottie...
Scottie?
I've been thinking.
Yeah.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Where's the damn wire?!
What?
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
What do you think would be in order?
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
What do we got?
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
Yeah, they are but...
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's nightmares. And of course, I need not add -
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me die.
Uh huh. And?
Tell me what?
Nine AM! But that's - twelve hours.
Me? Me, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to that piece of -
You're Death's brother?
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of that schtick.  So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be grateful?
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying. And you didn't hear it from me.
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
What are you watching?
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
Julie?... Hey, you are a looker.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
My tail itches.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could both be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't count.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
How'd you get in there?
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH--  Something went very, very wrong here.
Oh, sure. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
I don't know.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Good morning.
Any children?
And you saw them happen?
It isn't all! I'd like to explainù
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
You are , aren't you?
Look, this is my house. I'd like toù
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Tell me more about yourself.
What?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Have you seen the papers?
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuffù
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
There's Times Square.
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Here's a nice place.
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, thatù
What did you mean by that?
Nothingù
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Humoresque? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
A girl?
No. It's nothing.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm crucifying him.
Huh?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
We're not going out tonight.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
How'd you get the picture?
Marvelous!  At two o'clock this morning
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Yes.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Yes, sir.
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
How is this, sir?
Thank heaven.
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
You can't?
What?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
All right.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
When?
Yes. That is to sayù
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
Nah.
I've got one for Cobbù
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Uh-huh.
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
What do they mean by this - Cinderella Man!
I don't remember. Cinderella Man! What do they mean by that?
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going toù
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
But -- who -- what --?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Me?!
Now, where were we?
Well, thanks, I - uhù  How do you do? What is your name?
Mrs. Semple?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Now wait a minute, buddyù
Your Honorù
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I write poetry.
Binge?
Who are they?
Farmer?
Where is your farm?
Oh. Oh!
Is Mary home?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
You have no pants, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
I did what!
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Hey, did you hear that?
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Good kids.
Uh-huh. What are they?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there..
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
I'm fine.
Are we?
What good stuff?
Did I have anything to say about it?
What kind of doubts?
What's that?
I have eighteen more minutes!
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Mr. Follett.
Stop now.
Why? I'm paying for this.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
No?
I never said that.
What's that?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
But you did come to me.
My pleasure.
I've had my moments.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- I treated myself too well.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Yes.
I'd better get in there.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You do?
Who was that?
What do you want to know?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
How long you been in this town?
It's a pretty piece of land.
...And?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
...so accomplished.
He told you.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Okay.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
-- Go on!
You're right, as usual. See you.
That would explain it.
What do you mean?
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
When did you start to feel this way?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Hmm.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
Maybe you'll catch it.
Is she against you getting help?
We don't discuss it.
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
You're doing great.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
Disgusting.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
That's... good?
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
Hello.
...How violated I feel?
Will you think about it?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
It's my bit for the community.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was 25 Signs He's Great in Bed. It was very fascinating.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- he handles produce well. Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
How are you?
Would you like another beer?
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Amazing.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
That's all right. What's on your mind?
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
You don't think I'm insane?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Damn! What is your name?
It matters to me.
And the drugs?
That'd be Lily.
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
You're completely reliable.
You want my advice? Far out!
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
What'd I do?
Wow.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Yes, yes it does...
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
The Inscrutable Six?
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
Frankenstein!
How 'bout giving me the tour?
Who's the artist?
I'm not that kind of girl.
Or talk?
Date?
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Who wouldn't?
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
My heart died a long time ago.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
This place is built like a fortress.
Because that's what it is.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
I can't.
Wait!... Look!
Sounds good.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
The Eradicators!
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...
So what can I get you?
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Ask her out.
Or Batman --
Do we have to?
The who?
To us!
Are you sure he's still lives here?
Are you sure he's still alive?
The bazookas?
With or without him, we gotta go!
We've got lift off!
Right.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Naw, it ain't like that.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
You paid cash?
Y'all never use it?
Suga!
Yup.
I'm gone.
Me neither.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
I ain't trying to rob you...
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.
You know what this is?
You already in.
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
Nothing.
I didn't see nothing.
The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.
Naw, you go first.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Me too.
Wait for what?
What you see?
You're welcome, Unc.
I will.  When can I come visit?
Hell yeah, I remember you.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Can I help you?
I don't play for no team.
What's the matter?
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
What it smell like?
All damn.
It's alright.
I'll remember.
I saw it.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
Smokin' what?
Excuse me?
What kind of activity?
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
What was that?
Are they still out there?
Sorry, dude.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
You wanna knock?
Hey.
Ya'll live around here?
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Get 'em, Craig!
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
I got fired too.
What?!
Where's Craig?
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
I got my mase.
What's the matter?
Have you any money?
Bring me forty-five back.
It's from Paris.
Aren't you late?
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
An omelet.
You should be more careful, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
Well, a hat...
And there?
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
What is it, Anna?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You want this?
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
I don't want to go to Siberia.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Or it might be the firing squad!
I can tell you exactly.
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the CafÚ de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
Right now it's on the balcony.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
Capitalistic methods...
He's cutting our throat...
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
Misha! Misha!
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
No, no.
Comrade Buljanoff...
I think I need my glasses.
I must be stern with you.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, If something smells bad
And there is a Russian saying: The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
All you have to do is say open sesame.
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
The Duchess...
The former Duchess!
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Good evening, Gaston.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Yes, General Savitzky?
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
If Lenin were alive he would say, Buljanoff
Yes, Leon...
What is it, my boy?
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
It's a real Paris reunion.
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
We don't want to be disturbed.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
I'll send you a muff.
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
No, no.
Comrade.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Brave... that's right.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Look for yourselves.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
That's even better.
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
What's new?
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
Allow me, Comrade.
We did our best, Comrade.
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
Well, we're back home.
Even the swallows are back.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Yes!
I must get into that country of yours!
Oh no. No visa.
Why do you need my finger?
Suppress it.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Your type will soon be extinct.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
I will do my best.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
And what is your profession?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Ni-notchka.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
Oh, let it ring.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
As a representative of Moscow...
Then do it through my lawyer!
I don't like your following me.
At what?
Then you should go back to your table.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, Hello
No.
No.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee. So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, I'm sorry
I don't look too foolish?
You remember this room?
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
You see I couldn't shout that.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
No... go on.
Did you make any change in this room?
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
How do you do?
And General Savitzky.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
No. Nobody will find us.
Not white, darling.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
...and we won't clench our fist...
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
Is this the wish of the masses?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, Ninotchka
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
Hello, Leon!
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Now, Swana...
Oh, yes.
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
What does he say?
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
Huh?
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
You haven't seen her yet?
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
You can't imagine.
Thank you.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes, Swana.
No... please...
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
All right, I'll listen.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
What?
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
You leave me no choice.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Why?
Good morning, Comrade.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Raw carrots and beets.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Where is that?
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
How is she?
So she did witness it?
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
You should get the order you want.
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
No, I didn't have to.
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Do you know who I am?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Thirty-two?
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
This is really awkward...
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
Did you watch it yet?
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Oh, Betty --
What?
What?
All the time...
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Do what?
We were engaged.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
Of course.
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
Why are you doing this to me?
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
That is a skill!
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I don't know.
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Make sure it's elevated...
What're you doing here, Roy?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday
Really?
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
Dr. David Ravell.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
God, that's awful!
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
You said in L.A., anything goes.
I was talking about what you could wear!
Who?
What? Where was he?!
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
Looking for someone?
Does he know you think he's real?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
I don't follow...
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
That is so right.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
What 'look'?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
Half.
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
That was a really shitty thing to do.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
I said, 'No.' N-O.
I'm not telling.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
What doesn't?
I never said that I believed...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Who's this?
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
It just didn't fit her profile...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
What do you mean?
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
Really?
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
I said I'll think about it.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
Waitaminute -
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
Do not seek the treasure!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
How'd he know about the treasure?
Fire! I hate fire!
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
He was never turned into a frog!
Now Penny, stop that!
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
in the gods huh?
That's not my ring.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, we need that ring.
Uh-huh.
That wasn't my doing...
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
So I borrowed it till I did know!
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
An' all my meals for free...
Isn't it, uh...
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
How-di-do.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spotù
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
I poisoned him.
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Oh hello, Anneû He types furiously.
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
This way.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
I knew your managing editor very well.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
Yeah - go on.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Come on, get going, get going!
Do you call yourself a reporter?
It has been alleged - yesù
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
ùMr. Schuyler .
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
She okay?
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Araby?
I'm not quitting!
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Dawson, sir.
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Oh no, sir!
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Outside!
ùand those and them.
Of course I haven't got a nose.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Hello, Stew.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
What could I be?
Here you are.
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Hey, Gallagher!
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
It'll be ready in a minute.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
There's nothing sudden about thatù  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Hello, Smith.
Holy jumping swordfish!
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Surely, come right in.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
You don't.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
And now for that twentieth crackù
Sure.
It's all right. Bring him in.
Hello, Joe.
All right, Grandmaù
Yes - the worm!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Yeah.
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
That's all I wanted to know!
Yeah?
Can I ask you a question?
It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.
... Sex.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
It's okay. It's alright.
And they won't be able to tell?
Sure.
I had to say goodbye.
Thanks ... I love you.
Hello Bill.
I'm sorry ...
How was your day?
Oh, George ...
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
I don't want it to go away.
No I'm not sweetie.
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
... Lover's Lane.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it love.
But it could happen.
Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
Changes.
Changes.  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
... How?
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Why don't you start by saying yes
Did you do this?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
It was accessible to everyone.
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
No it isn't.
What color is that hedge of yours?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Get lost!
YOU get lost!
Oh my God.
Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
Oh God.
What's going to happen?
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
You know him?
Play along?
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Can we do any better?
What?
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
They don't have that kind of potential.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
It's okay.
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
What's wrong?
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Sure.
Yeah ...
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
Honestly ... no.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
Oh ... Hi.
Oh ... Right.
You don't know?
So what's it like?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
What's that like?
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Real rain?
You're gonna forget about me.
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
... Her father.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  For the very best in men's attire
My name's David.
... Hi.
... Only if they mean it.
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Forget about that!
So they can have their hamburgers!
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Open it.
It's beautiful.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Hey.
Cool.
This is Barry.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Well, I can't talk though --
Yes, I'll be there.
No, no, no.
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Why?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
...please, I just don't want it....
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
You just said very food.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
It's not cool?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I don't know.
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Goodbye.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
I....please don't do this.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
....no....
Really?
It doesn't matter.
...yes...
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Not very late.
Yes.
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
Hello?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
I don't know.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Yeah.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Yeah, not really.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
No. I'm the exact opposite --
It's terrible, no.
Oh My God.
-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
Ok.
Sure.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Yeah?
You were talking about the promotion --
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Yeah.
You see?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
No I didn't say that.
Nothing.
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Ok.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes no not really.
Yeah.
You don't think you'll go --
This is Lena.
Have a good trip.
Thank you.
It's Barry.
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
Do you wanna have sex?
Yeah.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
...what...?
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
For work.....
Yeah.
I thought that you were anyway.
Are you ok?
I'm sorry.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Ok.
Why?
I don't know.
I cut myself.
Why? ...what?
I know.
That's fine.
Barry Egan.
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
.....Well yes I do....  But one more thing I wanted to tell you guys about the new plungers is that we're making the handles now in a non-breakable material called.....
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
What is this?
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
So what should I do with the pudding?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Yeah.
....now: this pudding?
Hi.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Right now, you're doing nothing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
You can't be late.
Seriously.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
Don't puss out.
Are you sure?
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
Bye, Barry.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
They do to!
Alex, what are you doing?
Thanks.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
It's coming!
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Okay. See you later, friend.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Then what are we going to do?
Let's get a hot dog.
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
Thanks, I'll be fine.
She killed herself a week before he died.
Where's Shorty?
Not in a thousand years.
Both of them?
Noooo!!!
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
We have to destroy him.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Huh?
Gear. You know, clothing.
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
How are we going to get them all up there?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
My God! Is she dead?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
Professor, we need to talk.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
You do.
Yours, or the turkeys?
Alright... I might need your help.
Alright, go to the belt store...
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Dog, you look hot.
Hello.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
MOTHERFUCKER!!
It's not fair!!
I didn't do it!
In a way...
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
A free thinker.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
...closed?
Yes, Betty.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
He was a President.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Gary.
Bottle.
I'm good.
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Two years ago, buddy.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
You said you had it all lined up.
Yeah, Conundrum.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
You still seeing that shrink?
And Lexapro, yes.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
How would you rate this one?
Just a minute!
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Uh-huh.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Pour us a couple.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Sure I know Maya.
You know that chick?
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
Have you no shame?
Fuck you.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
I want to go home now.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
What?
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
I'm fine!
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Oh, boy.
Hey, there you are.
Besides what?
What?
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Nice shot.
Nope.
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Throw me his ball.
With Maya.
Slaughterhouse.
What exactly are we going to do?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
Huh.
Put me down, Jack.
It's private.
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
What's it look like to you?
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
Fucking chick's married.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
Yeah.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
So what's the plan?
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Yep. Quite a day.
Want me to drive?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
You're so negative.
What's wrong?
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
You need a new car anyway.
Why don't you come in?
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Love you, man.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
You were wearing your belt.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
I finished it.
See you.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
Hi.
Hey.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
Is she sleeping or...?
You got kids?
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
A paper?
What about me?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I had class.
Well, nice to see you now.
About two-thirty.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Were you ever going to say anything?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
So how're you doing?
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
I am.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Yeah.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Stephanie! Stop!
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
It was a surprise, Mom.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Slut.
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
No shit.
Carl, what are you doing?
Sounds familiar.
Bus broke down.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
This is his room... isn't it?
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
I --
Amen.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Is that right?
What's wrong?
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Look. You want to talk about this?
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Get out of here.
No. Not without you --
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Like your guitar break.
Carl.
Why bother?
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
Whatcha' doin'?
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
I'm sorry.
What?
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
You took Bill.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Rorschach.
Shelby --
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Brought you munchies.
Meat.
Sure thing, killer.
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
That's disrespectful.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
I never danced in a towel before.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Welcome home.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
My present?
You're pretty.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
You paying for the gas?
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Okay.
Driving?
A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
What the hell are you doing?!?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
Hey...
See ya, Kate.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
But you'll do it?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Cledus.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Running blocker.
Go.
Six. Got it.
Bandit?
Why are we doing this?
Loud and clear.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Let's keep it that way.
Redneck heaven.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Bandit?
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy.
Do I have a choice?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
I'm all ears.
I'm here.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Go head on, breaker.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Shut up, Fred.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
To Earth. To offer testimony.
I do this because I was there,
Humans make illogical decisions...
Just a couple of kooks...
Fine. Just fine.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
What do you mean?
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
An experimental device, doctor.
Come on, Pavel...
Hi... Busy?
... My shoes...
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Really? You think this is its way of saying Hi there to the people of the Earth?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
... I don't think he understands...
You're saying... It is a compliment.
It is.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
Ohhhkay. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
I buy that. What about him?
We don't want to be any trouble.
Go ahead.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
You want the details?
Here... In the park?
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
You tricked me.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Permission granted.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
Surely you can be more specific...
What are the variables...?
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
But you said toxic.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
For example?
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
Spock...
I cannot tell a lie.
The hell I can't
... I see.
I meant --
The tank will be finished by morning...
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
They did, Admiral.
Then... Where the hell are we?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we sink.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Picture, please.
On screen!
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
Any luck...?
Put them on screen!
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
How long, Scotty?
I'll have to re-energize.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Shut up.
I'm sorry?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Thank you, Nikki.
I'm Mike.
How was it hard?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.
...you might get cut out.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
What else is going on?
Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that the money?
No.
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Let me just check on my boy.
Oh... right.
Huh?
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
Well... This is it.
Listen. I had a great time.
Me too.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
Yeah. And an actor.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
It's not going to well?
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
Well, I should be getting...
...get the hell outta here already...
Lorraine?
I thought you met someone else.
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
You don't call.
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
It sucks.
Unless she comes back first.
No problem.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
What do you want? You're tall.
I don't talk about her that much.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
I'll get a Dewars rocks...
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Ah, there's the rub...
...yeah, a month ago.
Well, let's hit that party.
Oh, like that song...
...A Boy Named Sue. I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
I got to at least try once.
What's the point?
Uuuuugh!
Oh boy.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
They turned you down?
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
You miss the pain?
Sure.
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
It's kinda money, actually.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
How's it going for you two?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Wow, I guess you were home...
We're going to Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas.
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
They're all skanks.
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
It doesn't matter...
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go.
Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that Jedi mind shit.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Nice, baby.
Age of Enlightenment. Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said Let me jump your ignorant bones....
Baby, we're money.
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend Doubledown Trent.
Oh... I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad... Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
So, what'd you say to him? Double down.?
No, man. I need to use the phone.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
She was hot.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
How?
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
This version doesn't have fighting?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
No.
Yeah.
It starts at eight...
...through the kitchen...
How you guys doing?
Minnie Pearl.
Or sometimes not at all.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
We're not messing with you...
How long do I wait to call?
A day.
What the fuck..?
You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Oh. He's got it under control...
Chelios to Roenick...!
Now?
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
Yes she did.
What was cold about it?
It's on.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
...it's on.
It is on.
The bear's got his claws back.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
You don't have to wait three days...
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
Smashing!
We know all that, Exposition.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
We won, Austin.
When do I begin?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Yes?
Be careful.
Right away, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Yes?
Hello, Exposition.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Carnies.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Yes, Basil?
Thanks.
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Why not? It's a question.
What's wrong with your hand?
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry?
My meat and two veg.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Why did you leave so soon?
Why?
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
Watch out, you're on my hair!
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Hello, luv.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Not now, Austin.
Shut up.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I'll hurry back.
Oh, behave!
Are you crazy?
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Everything seems to be in order.
Where did you learn to shoot?
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
My son?
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Quite impressive.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
Hi.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
An evil petting zoo?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
How do you like Santa Carla?
You better get some fresh air.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
Zero.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
Did you ever want to?
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Good.
Two down and two to go.
The meanest!
That's right.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Star?...
I can't beat a Triumph.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
Don't!  Stop!
What's goin' on, Marko?
Where is she?!
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
For a ride.
You can't kill me, Star.
I will, David!
I can't do that!
Hit the lights again.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
There's a cop behind us.
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
David.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
You didn't tell David?
For everything.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I'll hitch.
See you later.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Okay?
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
I'm tired now.
Michael!...
Smells like something died.
I thought we were poor.
You've heard this story before?
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Soon.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Where's Michael?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
Not impressed, are you?
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Boy!  Somebody areound here sure has bad breath!
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
What?!  Did you know that!?
Are you following me?
Well, I...
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
I know, I've felt it...
Take laddie.
Huh?
Entertain yourself.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Piss off.
He was protecting you!
What about Mom?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
What's the matter?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Stop it!
Gay? He said you were gay?
He implied it.
Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
I don't know.
Yeah, right.
You're kidding? What did they say?
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
His mother?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Amen to that.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
I am?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Hm?
Bob, do you remember Mary?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
You got a brew?
We're in love with your roommate.
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Very nice.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Nineteen months I been sober.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Here, just have one of these then.
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
Who the fuck is it to you?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Dumbshit.
Nepal? Have you been?
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Some buildings I'm working on.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
I know he's around here someplace.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Lint?
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
A fucking moron.
Love story of our time.
Well, I'll see ya.
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Turn it up, Magda.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Sure.
Who the hell's Woogie?
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
All you want is a phone number?
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
No.
She's blackmailing you, right?
You can't be serious.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
Huh?
Oh my.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Hey, hey, hey!
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Among others.
Kim and I are close friends!
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
Who?
What do you mean?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
How'd you manage that one?
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
'That right? Good for you.
I'd go with the seven.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
What's a mook?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Pat does projects all over the world.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Can I pour you one?
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Oh Jesus...
Oh yeah. Fine.
Just a minute.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
Hm?
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
I agree there should be more.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Go!
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
You forgot your keys!
Really?
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
I, uh... I got it stuck.
It.
I think a little of both.
Oh God.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Burt, can you hear me now?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Oh my God.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
No.  We go straight.
Nope, there!  That's one.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Why?
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Well, you're the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Jeez, look at that guy.
You got that right.
Oh, Jesus!!
Val!  Val!
Jesus!  I don't believe this!
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell you. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really in on something here!
You got that right!
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Watch your ass, shithead.
They're...they're trying to make us move!
People?  Hell, National Geographic.
No ties.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Why do you all keep asking me?
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
Not interested.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Great car.
I'm very happy for you two.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
She's mine!
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Cole?
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
I'm going now, Cole.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
That feels so great.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
You're really pissing me off.
I don't believe you.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Yes...
Are you okay?
Yeah.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Ilene, Rick promised...
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Ilene, are you crazy?
Expensive?
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after Falcon Crest.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
What the hell are you doing?
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Mrs.?
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
The candelabras were my Gran's.
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
He's right, you look horrible.
How are you, Crabtree?
Emily?
Your wife.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
She's a transvestite.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Where the hell is he?
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
He has a book.
He lives with his mother.
Tripp.
Hit your brakes.
Just go around him.
Shit.
Tripp, where the hell...
You stay there.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
So sensitive.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
Evidently.  Coming!
So -- what do we do now?
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Don't touch it.
So whose car is it?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
No wonder he screwed us over.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
In a sense.
I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
Do you know he won't expel him?
No. But I don't think that matters.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
You peeked, didn't you?
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
Excuse me?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
It's very convincing.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
Heaven?
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
Is that really it?
Go ahead.
You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?
Right.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
Is he all right?
What's he saying?
Thank you.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Oh.
Sure.
He didn't give his name.
Yes.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
So where have you been staying?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
How'd it go?
I'm proud of you, lad.
Glaucoma?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
What kind of dancer?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Kinship.
The one that left you?
Maybe she didn't come here.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
It feels really... good... here.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
The hell I am.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
Want a bite?
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
I'm not going with them.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Take care.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
Do?
That strikes me as odd.
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
Grady!
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
Jesus.
Who does?
It beats 'What's your major?'
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
You go first.
I'm pregnant.
She's left before...
She's left the room before. She always came back.
Yes.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
You heard? How?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
All right.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
That... and you.
Who's that sitting in your car?
James Leer.
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
Grady.
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
And what did you say?
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I know.
Dozens. It's very sad.
Oh?
The more the merrier.
Who?
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
I... I...
Her husband.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
Maybe I should read it.
Where's Emily, Hank?
Just kidding.
I might have his number on campus.
Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room.
There's so many...
You want to keep him happy.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Nine.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Oh, it's all right.
Oh.
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
Sure.
I'll murder that Lennon.
They'll be here.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Me? Why?
You do - repeatedly.
Of course I can.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I'll have a bash.
Ta.
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
Now, you'll like these. You really dig them. They're fab and all the other pimply hyperboles.
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
I don't care.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
It is, y'know.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Did you look in here?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Is he?
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
I'll look in here again.
Come here.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
D'you know something, They don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Is it ... is it, really?
Something like that.
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
But that's not like a real person at all.
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, Go and give some to the other kids. So, I said I would but I thought to meself, She must think I'm soft. Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Is she?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Parading?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Oh ... I dunno.
I'm not wrong.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
What are they saying?
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Why do you always use your left hand?
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
Anything to spare?
Is that yours?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
How d'you reckon that one out?
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
Don't be callous.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
So's mine.
You needn't bother.
Y'what?
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Well you're not going.
Aye, well, now!
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
I would though.
Oink! Oink!
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
You've got a midnight matinee.
What?
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
Hello.
Oh yes.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
That's what you tell me.
You're a window rattler, son.
He's betrayed the class.
Temper! Temper!
Well!
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
Aye, I suppose so.
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Yeah, you want to watch it.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ...
Down the ... er ...
Yeah, down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet. Blimey!
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig  that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Sorry.
Thanks coach.
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean really fast.
Not bad, Chris.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Um...Chris --
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my most emotionally significant moment was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
You want onions?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
...I've never tried it.
You got it, stud.
Do you?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
I do, baby, I do.
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Like a bet?
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
I'll save you a seat.
Did I miss anything?!
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Holy shit.
She's already on a plane back home.
Back out?  You don't need us to get laid.  You afraid or something?
Nothing!
Yes dad.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
That is a nasty story!
...excuse me?!
Don't you want me to?
Okay!
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a cartoon, dude.
No -- Kevin, you?
Fun loving -- insane.
This was remade?  Into what?
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
You can do that?
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
I still think you're okay.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
No...you...go...ahead.
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
I suppose that would be okay.
So you need to change, right?
Strip?
Nadia, I can't --
No, not again.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are.
Kevin, this is serious!
Not for you.
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Just a second!
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
Like how?
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going I was wrong.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
Yeah, are you?
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Okay.
Yeah Vick?
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Qualify for what?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
Contact, dude.
Feeling better, Oz?
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Attitude?  Me?  I think that you guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
It was a pact.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
I don't care.
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at her store.
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
Shut the fuck up.
I think you need your balls reattached.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Our last game is this Saturday.
No it isn't! You're dead!
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Uh-huh. Good for you.
Come on. I'm from New York - the shoot me state. Don't wait up.
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
Hello?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
A cure?
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
I hope they fucking fry us all.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
What...?
No wonder he let her go.
Really.
It's making me hungry.
Well, they are French.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Andy...
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
Oh no... no....
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
Why the fuck would I do that?
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
Sort of...
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
Why would he pick this one?
Not that I know.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Allo?
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite intense. So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. The great cure for lycanthropy! Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
You don't want my autograph.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Alvy.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Hey, that was last year.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Oh - you're an actress.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Okay.
I'll getcha a piece.
Oh, you do?
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Yeah.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Yeah, my grammy.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Oh, I see, I see.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, yeah.
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Hey, listen, listen.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Oh.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
No.  You're a wreck.
Good? I was-
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
Oh! Italian, right?
You see, like you and I...
You are extremely sexy.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Don't you think I do?
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
I have a tiny apartment.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, Modern American Poetry? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take Introduction to the Novel.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Uh-uh-why?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
You followed me!
Existential Motifs in Russian Literature! You're really close.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
Yeah?
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
G-go on, I'm interested.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
M'hm.
and I keep, you know, it's-
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Yeah, but you said, Will it change my wife!
No, I didn't.  I said, Will it change my life
You said, Will it change... Wife. Will it change...
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
No.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Yeah.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Yeah, where is the spider?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Okay, let me have this.
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
It's for my complexion.
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
What?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Yeah.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
What... huh?
Oh! My God!
What thing?
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
God.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
God.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
Hey, you didn't read Death in Venice till I bought it for yuh.
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
I thought just earplugs.
What'd I do?
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
What-
Where are you going?
I can think of another word.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Oh, do yuh?
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Tell him.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Mean?
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
Oh, Jesus.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
And... uh-
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
Hi. How do you do.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Yeah. Right.
We really had a good time.
No.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
...of possibly working together.
Oh.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Yeah.
And here, you just-
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Was it a contractor?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
And how's the diva doing?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
The movie.
What?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
October-ish.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
It's alright, isn't it?
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
Of course.
I'm not.
Why didn't you bring him?
He's allergic.
To dander.  Otis.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Really?
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Let's get the kids.
Would you leave us alone right now?
He's not going tonight.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
Take good care of it.
Anymore.
That for us?
Just did.  Jealous?
So?
Lucy overdosed.
Stupid tart.
You have?
Well it's fucking time.
Forget it, Judy.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
I love you, you're a genius.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
He's directing now.
There's still time to undo this.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Whatever you say.
Did he promise?
You're out of your mind.
Beats a lawsuit.
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel?
No luck.
We're ready when you are.
Accept a compliment.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
You want me to uninvite her?
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
Not properly watered.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
It's ecstasy, Sal.
She left the fucking gate open.
Well he can't have gone far.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
He'll find his way back.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Otis!!!!
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
This is insanity.  Sally...
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I know.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
That's under lock and key.
It's a Calder.
I know.
Oh, you know, I am.
Has she called?
Come on, Panes...
Coffee?
I'll do it.
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
No.
Yes I did.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, what's this? You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
The infamous dog?
You might be right.
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Hm.
And Ryan works at home.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
I need to leave you now.
I'm not smiling.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Okay.
Medallions.
A lot of cakes.
And he doesn't smoke?
How long have you been married?
You must have been a baby.
That's very nice.
Sorry?
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
Trust him.
Seconds and thirds, too.
Ryan.
He always has two or three going...
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
God willing.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Not at all.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Yes.
The charades.
That was my clue.
Really??
Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Yeah.
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
She's all over him, are you blind?
Fuck you, Panes.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Okay.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Well, something's wrong.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
I didn't know you had this.
I don't mind...
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
Like Joe.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Would you like to meet my husband?
I thought it was okay where it was.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
I trust you.
Oh Soph...
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
And Cal's this massive adult?
His sister does.  Big time.  And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's two million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
What are you talkin' about?
Damn skippy.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Wanna dance?
Really?
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
I'm Princess Bala.
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Yes.
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Quiet -- sshhh!!
No!  There's no such thing as just two ants.  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
I didn't choose him.  What kind  of idiot would...  ...choose who she wanted to marry?
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
I ruined your life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was happily miserable.
Stop fooling around in there.
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
This is all your fault!!!
Come on, Z.
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
You held onto this all that time?
Why do they have you tied up here?
The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
I...I have no idea, sir.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
So...you two are in love?
...Not enough food?
That can be done.
Oh, of course --
...I should?
Did you see that?  How he gave you the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Wear this.
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
That makes me feel just terrible.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
How many of those drinks did you have?
I thought so.
This is a bad day for me.
Your phone.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
No -- I don't want anything.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
Baxter.
They had to pump it out.
Thanks for reminding me.
Open it.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Are you supposed to?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Yes, nurse.
I don't?
Fine. How's your eye?
I never thought he'd do it.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Oh.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
Where is your apartment?
How do you work it with the key?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
You know how people talk.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Now hold on, Baxter --
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Good evening, Baxter.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Slow down, kid.
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
What's her address?  Where does she live?
How's the patient?
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Where are you moving to?
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
I'm with you, lover.
Good night?
Kubelik.
A.W.O.L.?
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
That guy really must've belted him.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Yes, I know.
How long has it been -- a month?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I don't believe you.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
Okay. I'm sorry.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Are you sure that's what you want?
I have that date -- remember?
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know niggers better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Are you there, Fran?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
The nerve.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
I told you -- with my mother.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
Go on.  Good so far.
I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
What are there character traits?
This could be bigger than Amos and Andy.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's The PJ's.
We think so.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
That's what I'm askin'.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Where do you go from here?
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
Huh?
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Is that so?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
How long has he been having problems?
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
His home number.
No.
Will you please take it?
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
So what's up with you?
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Spence.
So what are you doing with a dog?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Sorry.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
How ya doing?
Uh, Udall?
Carol the waitress?
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
What needs clearing up?
Okay.
Lovely.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, what? I thought I said, what?... What?
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
Two days.
You take off when you have to.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Hello?
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
I was going to do that for you.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
No.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. Hate
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Never.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
The two might go together.
So long.
What do you want, Melvin?
What do you want?
I had to see you...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Okay.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Do you know how you will use him?
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
Was this supposed to be your room?
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Can you not be violent?
Uh-huh...
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Good night.
I just love her.  How're you doing?
But what about...
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
She's nice.
What?
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Hello.
Terrify me?
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Well, that's a load off.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Thank you for walking him.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, sweetheart...
Yo, yo, yo...
Would you leave now, please?
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
Never a break. Never.
This stuff is pointless.
Not it at all, really.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
Melvin...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
Another place where?
Hello.
I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired.
What did she say?
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
What's wrong?
The big one.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
Who's side are you on?
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
So you have your small victory, now what?
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
For what?
Is that good or bad?
How so?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
I feel fine.
So they can be on TV.
You sound like the media.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
No joke.  Serious.
No.
Yeah.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
I can't go all the way down south.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
Not her, the one with the little...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
I don't know who I am.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
The good stuff.
Oh you do, huh?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
For what?  He left.  Not me.
Y'know what?
And what?
Just ask me what you want to know.
Aw, c'mon.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
There's another one we owe 'em.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Same one you had yesterday?
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Arachtoid.
We will, old fried, we will.
Anybody we know?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
To get my guns.
Raise your hand...where?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
He offered you money?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
No, I don't.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
Any time.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Absolutely.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
Your face smells like a foot.
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
What happened?!!!
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.
Well, there is that ...
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
Yeah, heh heh.
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh huh.
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
That's not that much.
Heh hmm heh heh.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Cavity search...?
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Not on him, Chief.
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Not now Bork.
Chief, look!
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Uh, ten uh...
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table and the cherry wardrobe!
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
But I'm not hungry, are you?
At least we won't have to worry about her.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
You left me.
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
Not really...  what's this?
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
That's all we need.
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
How long do you suppose we were waiting?
It's not stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
Here's something.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
What happened?
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Honey.  Let's go.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
What makes you think she likes me?
What...?
Give or take a year.
Aren't you scared?
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through Handbook for the Recently Deceased.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... I am strange and unusual.
Really.  I don't know.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got above a C on science.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Are you available?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Well, we didn't know --
We're...
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have killed him.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
What about Betelgeuse?
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
We're practicing.
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
Where'd they go?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Otho'll know what to do.
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
The attic room is locked --
Answer your mother.
Not a building!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the whole town.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Any particular kind?
I saw some ghosts.
Of course we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've got to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all over you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never lived!
You read my mind!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Viridian?  What is...?
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a science, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly sick!
Oh my God!
Oh, as long as we're here...
Attic space.
Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in sheets!
Look at that detail!
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Otho, that's terrible.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Their wedding clothes.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
... Straight out?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Yes, I will.
Hardly any, Robert.
... Oh? You've heard?
Yes, I suppose that's true.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
There's no need for a hospital.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Your family doctor?
I agree.
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
I like to watch. This is fine.
I am a very good gardener.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
He does...?
Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Of course.
Yes, so do we.
So am I, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
How is Ben feeling?
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
No, thank you.
I see.
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Yes.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Yes. I like to watch.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Hello, Sid.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Hello, Morton.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
Ben is very ill.
I certainly do.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes. I like that very much.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. I am very hungry.
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Bravo!
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
Well, that's good news, my boy.
I see, Ben.
... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
Yes, Ben - he is.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
No, Ben.
I understand.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Yes.
Yes.
I never needed money.
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
How long do we stay in here?
... Evening, Chance.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
... I see.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
I live here.
Since you were a child?
No.
How were you paid?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Correct.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
You heard?
Do you need a secretary?
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Hello, Sophie.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure...  ... Let's just keep everything legal.
Yes? What have you found?
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
No, sir.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
Ben!
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
... Well?
Mr. Gardiner...
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Did you eat?
The iguana.
'kay.
I want to try.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
I have to go back now.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
So how was it? What was he doing?
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. WeÆll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
What are you doing?
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
What?
We wish.
You were him last night, weren't you?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Shut up!
You fell in love with her first.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, he's some kind of monster.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
You came up here looking for the portal?
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
I know.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Sure, after a fashion.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
I said yes.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what youÆre implying.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
No. I understand perfectly.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain ôdoorsö which should never be opened.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
I'm right?
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
DonÆt let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
You're a fag or a liar.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
You're late.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Yes, my dear?
Thank you, Floris.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Anybody else?
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Oh, be still my heart.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
You bastard!
No! Don't harm the vessel!
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. Ever want to be someone else? No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding...
When?
One hour.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Never heard of it.
Is there dancing?
Can I get you a drink?
Thanks so much for coming over.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Derek Mantini!
Hiya Allan.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Why me, man?
Uh-huh.
This is our concern, Dude.
I know my rights.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Nothing.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Walter, how--
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
What tied the room together, Dude?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
Huh?
He peed on the Dude's rug--
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
They posted the next round of the tournament--
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Who has your undies, Walter?
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
No--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
I've had a--
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his dick or his rod or his Johnson.
I was talking about my rug.
Take a look at this, sir.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
From who?
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Well yeah...I know that.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Jeffrey.
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Oh?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
Huh...
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
What's your point, Walter?
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Am I wrong!
Donny!  Please!
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
What the fuck are you--
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
No, you're not wrong--
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Calmer than you are.
I told him if it was during league play--
The what?
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Agh--
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam--
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
Uzi?
Walter, please--
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
For Christ's sake, Dude.
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
Whose toe was it, Walter?
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Not if I have anything to say about it.
This whole fucking thing--I  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Nihilists!  Jesus.
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Not exactly a lightweight.
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
Look, man, did you--
Is this your homework, Larry?
Dude?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Shit yeah!
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
Huh?
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
Yeah, and you were--
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
Oh, shit.
We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.
Uh-huh.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Hey, cool it Walter.
No Dude.
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
Walter Sobchak.
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!
You're a fuck, Walter!
Dude here.
Dude here.
Dude.
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Did I urinate on your rug?
Are you employed, sir?
Employed?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
I'll tell you what I'm blathering about!  I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Well?  Aren't you?
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Oh, shit.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
You've made my dreams silly.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
Wait.
You packing up tonight?
London.
Hold it down, okay?
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
Okay.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
Okay.  Let's do me.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
What happened?
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Well, whatever you think.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
They're not that dumb, after all.
Did you bring your grey suit?
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
If...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
I lost six pounds...
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I have to be somewhere.
Don't go.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
This isn't friendship.
I think you're the Devil.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
So who's the guy?
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
Yeah --
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Do it then.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
Thanks.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
The cost-efficient reporter.
How long has it been since you've been home.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
But thanks.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
Yes?
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Let me hear it!
Right there, Bobbie.
Follow me.
I really have to go.
That's okay.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
Fill for a second.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
Hi.
Yes.
Nervous?
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
Jane?
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Yeah.
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
Uh-uh.
At least kiss me when you do that.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
That's not it.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
What happened?
I know.  I taped it.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
No.  Did he really?
What?
That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
How can you say that to me?
Then give me a minute...
You fucking...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
It's better when you let me say it.
A picnic?
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
Are you okay?
Not anymore!
If you were an artist you could have created something!
I'm going home!
Yeah.
N-no...
Um...
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
Whaddya mean?
I'll pose any way you want.
A thing I made.
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
Of course...it's wonderful.
Murdered man.
Look at the size of it!
Me too.
It wasn't easy.
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Carla...
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
Oh...
There there...
Walter!  Jeez!
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Are you ready?
Nice night out...
Of course I do!
That means you like me!
I like you very much, Walter.
Why not?!
Just about anything, Walter.
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Walter...there's...
That's word for word.
When did you make this, Walter?
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
Walter, what are you doing?
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
Dead Cat!
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
I don't have another cat!
Well...why murdered man?
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
I can't talk right now.
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Uh, hi.
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
Did you see my cat?
Huh?!!!
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up.  It doesn't fly with me.
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Turn around!
Uh, I don't know.
Hi.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
Why not?
T-turned on?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
What's with you?
Nice game.
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Booo!
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Would you sleep with them?
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Invite me in, Pike.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
You look like shit, Benny.
Wheels?
Yeah, I guess.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
It's the news, Buffy.
So I noticed.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
You left me a message?
I am so sure.
Will you guys shut up, please?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Is that your car?
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Yeah.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
For the dance.
I'm going to the dance.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Leave me alone.
I'm glad you came.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
Like my homework.
Why don't we see a movie?
Nice ensemble!
Let's meet tonight, okay?
You were supposed to be here at three.
I'm looking for you, actually.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Wait!
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
In Virginia.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
None of your business.  God.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
All right.  What do we do now?
Where's the other one?
Skip it.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Not a pressing issue.
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
What!?!
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
I wish you would.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Wait!
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I was just scared is all.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
I guess.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Nicole...
I haven't seen him tonight.
Okay, let's go.
Well, I hope so.
Nee sitch.  No way.
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Oh, God.
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
Oh, please.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Right!
Nice much.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
I really was way way too too.
Except for Prom.
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Run.
You mean Nuke.  You said Crash.
I didn't say Crash.  I said Nuke.
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
The right nostril.  Good.
I'm really beat.  I need some serious z's--
Switch nostrils?
It's all the same thing.
I'm yours.
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
You can't seduce me.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a V shape?--
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
No!  You're playing with my mind!
I think you're real cute.
it's okay..
I'd like you to meet my father.
You don't have to...
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
I won't be needing these anymore.
Don't worry.
I'm Crash Davis.
She's dancing with me.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
That's my job too.
No.  Please.
Damn.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
Annie, I think you should leave.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
Whatta you mean why not?  Are you gonna play forever?!
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Yeah...you a witch?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
I can do that, too.
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
No ballplayer ever said no to a date with me.
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
Shh, shh...  They will not let me off till I go with them
I got him on the knee!
You spit on me!
You're a cocksucker!
I thought I was--
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
But he ain't seen my heat--
Fastball.
Why's he always call me Meat? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
Can I ask you something?
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Jesus.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Settle what?
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
No.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Fear and ignorance.
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
You too...Meat.
I don't believe in fighting.
See ya at the yard, Meat.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
Eight and twenty-four.
Jim looking for somebody.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Ch...
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Good.
And...
Hold on.
Right.
Right.
No.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Uh. Do you like England?
I saw you waiting there, by the gate.
What? What does he want?
What did he say? Tell me!
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants money.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Yes.
I mean... Ants. I've got a problem with ants.
Syevodnya?
They go.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
In every sense. If at all possible.
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
He will come back.
Excuse me?
I don't want to talk about it.
You don't want to talk about it.
And. It's wrong.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
What?
It wasn't what I wanted.
You don't understand me.
You don't understand you either.
Excuse me?
I wasn't saying anything.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Thank Christ for that.
Not really. Maybe a little.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I'm sorry.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Yeah. No thanks.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.
Okay. Promise?
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Whatever.
What does it mean?
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Ours.
I believe you.
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
I said with the mouth shut.
Me?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
He was American?
About how wealthy would you say?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- ElysÚes  Why there?
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
Good for you.
I'm not sure I --
Yes, but we're divorced.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
We'll find you a hotel.
What was all that?
En garde.
I don't think I follow you.
What was it?
We're here.
How would you like a spanking?
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
What?
help me get in the truck.
Shit!
...-ty.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
Since today.  New policy.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
Hang on.  Hang on.
No.
What did I say?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
I need your truck.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...-er.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
And if that Elvis shit...
Peace.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
I need your truck!
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you
Come on, get in the truck.
You stole this truck.
...the ice cream for money!
I ain't playin' that.
Shut up.
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
...-damn!
You're nuts, goin' back there!
Doesn't work.
What?
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
Okay!  All right!
Okay.
...gun?!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Well, then, that means it's call...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
...up!
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
I think...
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
Goddamn!
I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Come on, old Pete.
God, man!
Come on.
I know the likeli-...
I made it.
Holy--!
Ho, ho...
Shit.
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
These'll keep it cold.
He's crazy!
I'm crazy?
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
What?
No!
Oh, no!
Uh-oh.
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
You're fucked, man.
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
So I took his truck, yeah.
Yeah.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
...-er.  It was your friend...
Whoo!
Yeah, baby!
A-And you  owe me...
Listen, Arlo.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
...-natic.
...to him.
...on!
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
Oh, shit.
Okay.
We've got Elvis!
Here...
...our ass!
He's comin' up fast!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
I'm gonna kill him.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
What?
We got-...
There's gotta be...
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Look out.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
...-tiatin'.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Ooh.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
...within five minutes.
Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
...without compunction.
...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
You-You can't let him...
What the hell's a sage?
Thank you.
I'd say we're about even.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
No!
No!
There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
You look good, Richard.
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
...-ple.
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...always done, Richard?
Went away.  I like that.
Forget about him.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
I'll do it.
This is it.
Radio the bikes.
You have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way.  I think we can impose on you for a little overtime.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
...-ty.
That's right.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
Where's their protective...
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
Iced coffee.
Quite a getup for jacking...
...Long.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...time to time, yeah.
...should be right outside.
Like I say, Doc Long's...
...to die for a country that's...
...never done a thing for you?
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
Elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  Get yourself some CDs.
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
Your fellow hero, untouched...
...and unharmed, de-...
No.
Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
Uh, we both like to fish.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...like a fish.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
The compound has to be kept cold...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
Forty-seven.
God!  They're gonna seal it.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I didn't sell the boy any...
...to talk, son.
Pappas!  Move the car!
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
Now raise 'em!
Don't move!
The Army, sealin' us in.
Yeah, I'm sure.
All right, go.
...-damn phone.
Arlo.
Oh.
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film.
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them!
Progress! It always arrives too late!
That's right, Modern Times.
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
Now what can you see?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand.
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
My husband...you know him.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
Am I sure?
Am I sure about what?
Unnhh!
Excuse me, but...
That's it, everybody out.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
He was?
Why?
My God. I haven't seen you since...
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
Was I right?
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
I just told you.
Jesus, you're caustic.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
You mean, on a date?
He's your fiancÚ.
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Um... okay.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
Oh God...
She thought it was me.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
In a second!
I can pass!
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase.  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Excuse me, do you have...
Annoying Customer.
Pack of cigarettes.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Cute cat. What's his name.
Peptic ulcer.
Yeah.
Oooh! Navy Seals!
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
You're late.
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
What time do you have to stay till?
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
I wanted to use your car.
Seven months.
Five years.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Oh, my God.
Great story, isn't it?
It takes different strokes to move the world.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
I'm talking to myself here.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
All four?
You know what I just watched?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Return of the Jedi.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Empire.
The Emperor.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
Wait.
Each egg has to be perfect.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
What did he say?
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
Can we talk about this later?
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
There aren't.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
All of them.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Sorry.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
We're not playing in the street.
Helluva game!
What happened to all the Gatorade?
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
It's today.
What!?
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
I can't close the store.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
How'd he die?
Bible truth.
Oh, my god.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
I could never reach.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
Jesus!
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
What?
No way!
Five hundred dollars.
Really?
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Then how come you got the fine?
You're happy?
What did she say?
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
Hey, what about Veronica?
What time did we go to the funeral?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
I should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
You didn't have to choke me.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do you say that?
Like ten after.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I know I can bench more than that!
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
You know him?
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
How do you know that?
No, she's getting married.
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
One seventy-nine.
A half hour.
Nothing personal.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
He died in the bathroom.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
You used to go out with her?
Maybe.
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
She's my girlfriend.
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
Actually, that's his night job.
So I'm told.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
I said go ahead.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
What were you doing?
How much money did you leave up there?
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
Oh, you think so?
And I actually date you?
You were making a generalization about broads!
How many?
How many girls have you slept with?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
All right. Name it.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
What do you mean?
He requested this?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
You sucked his dick!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
How many?
HOW MANY?
This is different. This is important. How many?!
What the hell is that anyway, something like thirty-six? Does that include me?
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
A few?
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Thank you for being rational.
What time do you get finished?
What the fuck did you do that for?
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
I don't want Caitlin...
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
I'm not out of shape!
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
He is.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
I'm not sad.
You're not?
He didn't ask me to...
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
No, I'm just visiting my man.  Dante, this is Willam Black.  This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Do you know who this is?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Should I call you back?
Uh, yeah.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
I don't know.
For what?
Get that, will you?
Because you're the closest.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
He said to go fuck yourself.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Turn on the flashlight.
You didn't buy batteries?
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
Do I?
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
Good idea.
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
Has to be.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Anybody hungry?
What?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
What do you want now?
I've got a way with people.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
I'll tell you when it's time.
Okay, we're square now, right?
Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
They don't serve wine here.
We've got to get out of here.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
Going somewhere?
It's good.
God, I want to go home.
Glenmorangie.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You wanna tell him?
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Did she break your heart?
Something like that.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
It's not your fault.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
Who are you waiting for?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Don't say a .
How much do you usually get paid?
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
Don't worry.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Dave...
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What the hell is this ?
The Washington Post.
No...
Great.
What do you think you're doing?!
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
I'm... not... nobody...
... what?
You're fired.
Fine...
Die, you pond scum!
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
I know.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Mild stroke?
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Exactly. A condition.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Clean.
What do you mean, he's clean?
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
Nobody's got clean kids.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
Uh, let me get back to you...
It's a homeless shelter.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
What's with the cameras?
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
Bob...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
What do you mean by that?
Just what you think I mean.
Sort of... Yeah.
Dave -- I'm working.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Well -- take care.
Oh my gosh...
I'm afraid so.
Really?   Crazy?
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
In the car?
At a press conference.
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
She knows.
Oh... Thanks.
What are they?
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Yeah.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
Really?
Of course.
I had a feeling.
What's that?
You're kidding.
No... They don't kid.
Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...
What?
I care about the homeless.
That was quite a thing you did today.
You weren't in the state legislature.
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
Home.
Where's home?
I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.
Truman used it all the time.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
What?
I really don't have much of an appetite.
That's a secret.
I guess.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
Yes.
I run a temp agency.
Yeah... Bedtime.
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
That's okay.
Yeah.   He's a good man.
It's nice.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
From over the mountain --
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
What's that, sir?
Anybody can see that.
But I like the new one better.
I did not, Grandma.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
What Grange?
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Never mind. What's your name?
Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad....
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
It's mine?
I don't care.
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Shall we?
How much?
Shake!
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Mary --
Consarn the consarn --
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Helps sometimes to say it.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
I want you to fix these fish!
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
Cup for cup!
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
Thank-Q!
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
For how long?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Get out of here!
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Get away from me!!
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're it until you touch someone else.
What is it?!
Perry?
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Excuse me.
In the new library there.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Hey guys.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
You did?
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
Yeah, but I'm buying.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
I'm fine.
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
What?
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
What? No! Look.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
Who's Principal Collins?
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
Oh, of course.
Go fish.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
She did not.
Kids.
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
Collins is a great man!
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Can he do that?
Owww... refreshing.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
What?
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
I haven't brushed yet.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
Yea!
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get some.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
I kinda screwed things up.
I don't think so.
You're always your harshest critic.
You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.
Go away, assface.
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
The answer is George Jefferson.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
You're welcome.
Okay!  Damn!
It's okay. I want the rush.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
Well, I'm listening now.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
What? What did we do?
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
A float!
Ready Lloyd?
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
See, ya.
Guys, this is much better.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
And with that complete loser
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
...Okay.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
That's not your tape.
I'll talk to you later.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Sure.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Oh, go on.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
They like Dr. Pepper.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
What?
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
Will that be on the midterm?
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
Or maybe crossing a river!
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Left here! Left!
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
And, take some more pictures.
Wow, you are smart.
What?
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Are you going to kill her?
This is horse?
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
Name it.
What for?
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
They're all divorced?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
That's what I was afraid of.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Stop that ma'am crap!
No.  I never drink -- wine.
No.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- and¾truck tour of Dracula. Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
You know, I saw you perform Dracula.  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  I need transvestites!
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
They do?  Shoot.  There must be a way to get around that...
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Bela, what happened?!
Greetings.  I am the Count.
So how'd we do?
You're shooting Bride Of The Atom. Scene 85.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
What is this place?
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Fuck you!  You come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Formaldehyde.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Sorry...
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I've never seen anything like him!
If you say so.
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Um, okay... roll camera
Sound!
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
You can't sit!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll never invest in our movie.
That's boring!
What?
I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
Better than not getting a job?
Boris Karloff!?
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
How long have you been doing this?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
And what about this so-called Barbara character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is our life!
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I wanted you to say, No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
I didn't dump you!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Hey, the movie's getting made. That's the main thing.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Did you really mean those things you said..?
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
I understand you just moved here?
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: The Vampire's Tomb
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I certainly do!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Well...yeah. Okay.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Raising money is tough.
Would that work?
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
So, Mr. Johnson --
I think you're quite handsome.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already pre¾sold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of special qualifications.
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
Who?
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
And don't be so obvious!
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in establishing shots!
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
The marriage already ended.
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
Oh.  I loved those shows!  Inner Sanctum... The Shadow --
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  No compromises.
What about her?
How 'bout this one?
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
Huh?!
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!
I'm really sorry...
You don't wanna be noticed?
It's uncanny.
Yes!
YES!  JUST DO IT!
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
What if--you're vomiting?
Do they show it?
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
What do you love her or something?
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
What?!
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
Ed, can I see you a second.
I want you to take this.
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
How you doing, Ed?
Uh-huh?
Sure.
Yeah.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said Sure
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Thank you. Can I see her?
What?
You said that.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
What?
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
He made a mistake.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
No! And that girl has a name.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Could've been a nurse?
Oh God. What hospital?
It was horrible. He called me up.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
So you had sex with him?
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
But Al is your husband now!
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
Shari, Ray feels --
What are you talking about?
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
I'm really sorry!
Are you asking me?
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Why do it?
Cream rinse?
Dynamite.
You do though, you look great.
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
I mean bad.
Really?
Oh yeah.
That's lucky.
Why?
Um...
There.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Look at this.
There's a list.
I'm sorry.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Okay.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say Hi to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
This is going right up your ass.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called On the Street Where You Live.  You know it?
What did you do to your hair?
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What are you drunk?
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
What is?!
What?
I'm doing all right.
Polish acrobat.
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Quick pull off the highway is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
It's me, Ed.
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Why me?
You brought the cameras here!
I know.
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Me?!
You know what your problem is?
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
No -- keep it.
Hi, Eve!
Hi.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Oh!!
Hm?
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
We don't have foibles.
That's the point -- this could change things.
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
But you haven't written your novel.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
No.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Thank you.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.
Is that a birthday cake?!
Gee-ma-nee!
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
You're kidding, right?
Mostly Tammy fans
Thanks, Mr. M.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
I know.
Ethics are...
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Hey, that's super
Here they are.
Looks good to me.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Of course!
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
Hello, Tracy.
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
So what brings you here?
I'm looking at new cars.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
Plenty of pep, too.
That sounds good.
So Tracy?
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
I've got an idea.
My house.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
Sure.
Shall we give it a name?
You're there.
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
Okay, let's say
Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Like a painting?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Yes, Paul?
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
Your mom made that all by herself.
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
I promise. Is that all?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
I'll try.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Uh-huh.
That's what everybody believes?
Uh-huh.
You have very nice ceilings.
You nut!
And it's called...?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Who use to own it?
When did we get it from them?
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
True.
Why not? He has great pants.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Why did you park way back there?
What?!
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
You bet!
What?
My father is a genius.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Just look!!
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Sorry, Mom!
I'm afraid you've got to.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
What?
We have to go.
This is your bedroom?
No.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Yes.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
As long as we've got that straight.
What's that noise?
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
You have tranquilizers?
What?
I've noticed.
Calvin?!
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Watch this!
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Hi, honey!
And I made these!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Sure.
I don't believe it!
We stay down here.
Excuse me.
Well, I am the head of this household--
--and we will--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
He's smart.
Yes, dear, I know.
Amen.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
What can I offer you, Eve?
You came back for these?
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
I see elegant.
What do you think, Adam?
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
That water's freezing!
Just be yourself.
Always good advice.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
He go back to the hotel?
Who did he leave with?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Where are you going?
What?
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
He didn't leave with them.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Coward!
What?!
What do you want to do with it?
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
What?!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Where?!
In 9th.  For a month
As in...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Adelle?
I can see that, Alan.
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Well, Alan, I think weÆre gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
But I think I like you better this way...
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Rise...and...shine...!
Mom, donÆt you think we need to open the presents?
Big EdÆs?  Big EdÆs Tires?  Why...?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ah. A classic...
WeÆre friends, arenÆt we?
You see, itÆs like weÆre in each otherÆs heads...
KateÆs my wife...
She said that?
It wouldnÆt really be cheating...  ItÆs complicated.
Look, maybe IÆm not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtationÆs harmless but youÆre playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
CÆmon, Evelyn ThompsonÆs got no class.  She doesnÆt marry Dr. Steve, the womanÆs living in a trailer.
ItÆs me, Jack...
I donÆt care if youÆre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still canÆt park here.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
HowÆd you know my name?
Yes, thatÆs it...yes, we went to high school together.
No.
A lucky streak, huh?
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
What?!
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
You canÆt do this. You canÆt keep coming in and out of peopleÆs lives, messing things up...
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
If youÆre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
You mean donÆt go at all? What about my internship?
For us, Kate.
No, youÆre right.  What are we doing?
I can't seem to let go of you...
Jack...donÆt even start...
Look, we donÆt have time for this right now, weÆll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  YouÆre not wearing that to the ThompsonsÆ party. I donÆt care how hilarious you think it is...
Party?  Oh no, I canÆt go to a party...
Telling my mother she doesnÆt have to stay with the kids.
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Jack...
Here you go...
ShouldnÆt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
She got those shoes...
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  WhyÆd we ever leave?
The trek out to the hospital every day didnÆt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You had a heart attack?
ThatÆs why I work for Big Ed?
I want it...
Say it, Jack...
Not it...?
Maybe I should wait...
No, open it...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until itÆs light out.
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Okay...
Now IÆm worried...just say it.  Whatever it is weÆll deal with it.
Now...I donÆt...
CÆmon, Jack, you think there arenÆt mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell IÆm doing in New Jersey...
IÆll just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
I donÆt know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
Way out...
I donÆt think IÆd fight you on that one...
ItÆs like a museum.
So whatÆs the big surprise? You didnÆt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
A perk for what?
What are you talking about, Jack?
I donÆt think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  WeÆll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Annie goes to a great school.
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
DonÆt worry about it, Jack...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and IÆm going to be heading it up.
Not with what they pay me...
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
DonÆt do this, Jack... But he continues...
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Peter Lassiter...
Not exactly. IÆve seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
You wonÆt regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/AÆs...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
I'm paying you.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
Got any more bread crust?
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
... So... where did you sleep last night?
Okay.  ... I love you...
You still believe in God?
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Hello....congratulations.
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... that's it!
Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  pain, your problems... You think you're entertaining?
How have you been?
But..How could that happen?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Come on now...You can't sit here.
I... I was just leaving.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  Raoul?
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline...
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
I need a drink.
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Have I died?
Where am I?
Sshhhh!
They said you're The One.
Oh shut up!!!
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
Take a guess...  Let him guess!!  Tch.
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
Him...?
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry.
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
You really want to help me?
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
You're a true friend.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
Are there any questions?
What?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Happily married, probably.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
What are the other reasons?
I know!
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
There isn't any more to tell.
What are we about to do?
Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
Hey, what are you doing?
They didn't do anything.
Fletch.
Fletch F. Fletch
I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
We play tennis at the club.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Like tonight.
I think IÆd rather have drugs.
Jesus.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
The two surfer boys?
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
You gonna nail the chief?
What?
Right. Fine.
You're in the Records Room.
Yes, right away.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Read this, please.
Cut the crap and read it.
Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
Right.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Velma.
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Check.
Oh, about ten days ago.
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Of course they are.
ItÆs okay. The cops did it.
They busted me last week.
They bust you every week.
What?
Why are they after you?
What's that?
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
I'm all ears.
I want you to murder me.
So why pick me?
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Take it where?
Where am I going?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
Maybe.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Yeah.
Nothing to it.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
I'm sorry?
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
How long have they been married?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
Why do you keep doing this?
Here, take mine.
Can I ask you a question?
Long story.
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
You saw a forgery.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
Act natural.
Gail, please.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
Come here.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
In her cabana, sir.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
What?
The door was unlocked.
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
Fletch.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
Well, there we're in a gray area.
I'd say charcoal.
Just give me a hint, all right?
Utah?
I have some ideas.
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.
Not really?
Fletch.
Yeah.
Frieda's boss.
I said, I ain't got you...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
I don't know, I never met your father.
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Who?
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Uh, let's go sit down.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Have what?
Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
No prob...
All your friends call you Jazz.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
You're saying you need money.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
So what about this watch?
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Hello, Ford...
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Peachy.
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...
Who cares about people?
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
But
Why didn't you tell me?
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
Forget it.
Who cares?  I got a case.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
Okay.  'B-y-e!
Let me go out like a man.
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
Well, hello, Ford.
Okay!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
Ah, I didn't say seven P.M., now did I?
Shit.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Julian, you're fired.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
Whaddya mean?
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
What?
Come and get it.
I hope so.
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Yes, but they released me because...
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Yes!
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
I used to drive a taxi.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
Shut up, Elliot.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Do not inhale.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
She's dying.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
This is how we've managed to last.
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
He will absolutely hate it.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Opening night?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Daddy, wait.
Yes.
See, Daddy.
Two-all after six.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
Who the hell cares?
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I am really, deeply sorry.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
I don't know if I can say that.
Life is real.
Who is it?
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
What do you want?
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
We must have been heroic.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
What do you want me to do?
Show him who we are.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
You're a family man, Frankie?
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
I don't know.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
Because God loves a winner.
Because life is good.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
This could be it!
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
'm not worried about this kid.
Postpone. We have every right.
When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
Why?
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know Macbeth.
Sidney remains optimistic.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
I think I remember.
A little.
What?
You know what.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
But you're his friend.
Where are you going now?
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Yes.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
I haven't come to you.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
That's not
Making Hutch David Soul?
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
No. This is he.
She's an attractive older woman.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
That sets it off.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Yeah.
Loop around real fast.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
You think we're going to be chased?
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
We know there's another stocker.
We got it. We got it.
What's wrong with him?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Can I get that credit card from you?
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
You were spoiled rotten.
Bob?
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Which one was that?
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
He told you and you let him do it.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Why don't you come with us.
Can you hand me those french fries.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
I think we better go home.
I'm not. But there's --
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
Right now.
What do you think?
Bob!
He doesn't want to fight.
So did you
Eleven fifteen.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
Yeah. As a girl.
Roger.
Take your second position.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
It's going back down.
Help me move him.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
Like amnesia.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
Yeah...
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Don't say that.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
The grandfather clock?
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.
It's always the little things.
Bad experiences.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
I'll think about it.
Hello...?
Flowers. That's funny.
You look beautiful.
Okay... Hold on...
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
No time.
Like heroin?
Like love?
He was trying to kill you, right!
Not the other way around...?
You're a government spook?
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
You never could have kept this from me.
You don't understand...
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
You know where I live?
We're both professionals, Oatman.
Morality.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Out Loud?
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Like a union?
Like a club. Work less, make more.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
No deal.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Okay.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
Well?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Wait a minute--
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
Yup.
One cannot love and kill.
Did you see Blank in there?
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Never enough.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
Will do.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
You have a headache?
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
Yeah...
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Paul?
Fair enough.
It didn't work out.
I have to get my head back into my work.
What?
Dignan, I --
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
You mean like techniques?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
Hold it.
How does that feel?
Did Dignan take the test?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Absolutely.
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Let them fight.
Yeah. He said that.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
I hope not.
Where you going?
You think he got my license plates?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Sixty days?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Give him a second.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Sure.
I didn't do anything.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Oh, listen...
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Are you really interested?
Oh--
Well, let's do it.
Great.
A lot of works.
Uh --
Yeah.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh, it's magnificent!
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Well, I live downtown.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
You're joking.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
I can't resist.
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
I cry at the opera.
What time do you get off?
Yes.
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
It's really sad.
Yeah.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
Hi, Dusty.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Uh-uh.
What are you doing here?
Yes?
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Uh, yes!
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
No, I don't think so.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
How's everything?
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
He's got like six gold records.
Yeah.
Oh, I would love to hear it.
What do you mean?
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
I was looking for you.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
But not over me?
I can't say anything!
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Is something wrong?
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Mm-hm?
Great idea.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Where're you going?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
It's so late.
But, you got four children!
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
No.
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
Leave me alone, can you?!
You matter to me.  Completely.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
You're not lost.
Oh, Mom!
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
I just wanted --
No! I just wanted
Wait. Did he see us?
No, thank you.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Mm-hm.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
Look at this guy.
Oh, Jesus!
N-n-no, not that.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Yeah...but you're not dying!
You're just realizing this now?
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
You've outdone yourself.
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
I bumped into your...
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Like what?
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Very good.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Yeah.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Thanks, thanks.
Oh!
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
This is the second opinion.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
What?  You're kidding!
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
I should get a garter belt.
Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
Oh, Hannah!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Oh, yeah.
He's married...
Oh?
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Really?
Uh-huh.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Can you use a coaster.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it.
Awwww...
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Oh, gosh.
You got it.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, Okay
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
No, not Oh
Well--
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
Well, why don't you share them with us?
No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Thanks for a swell time.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
At least I'm open to new concepts!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
Oh, no.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Nobody ever said it.
Really?
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
You're kidding me.
Oh.  Oh.
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh!
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Tch.
Mickey?
What was that all about?
Dad...
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
Maybe she turned.
I think we might of scared her.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
Bob.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Don't count it.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Bob, will you please listen?
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Go stand by the flagpole.
When all else fails, Jasper--Gum. Even now in these troubled times,                           ] every child's drug of choice.                               ]
Your Secret admirer?
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
What are you doing?
Why do you even like me?
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Yes you do.
Iunno.
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling. It's all about                            ] the evolution of the species, we                            ] can improve...                                              ]
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--love you
It's been known to happen.
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the test...Do you believe me?
Next to boring
God, you're beautiful.
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay...
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
Don't say that.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
See you in a little while.
Gee, thanks.
You can go first, Bob.
What are you talking about?
Things are going to change, Earl.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
I was talking with someone!
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
I said I was sorry.
I'm going back.
Give it up girl!
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Heather, I've got something going with J.D.
I can't do that, Bob.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? Bringing every State to a Higher State.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
What's his name?
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
What are you doing? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Yeah, great.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
Like a suicide thing?
I die knowing no one knew the real me.
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
You must have had fun.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Kurt doesn't look too good.
Did not.
Did not.
Anthony. Bad news.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
Phase my ass! You'll be back! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Not bad.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
It's over, J.D.  Over!
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
This knife is filthy.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
I guess.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Bullshit.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
He's having a heart attack or something.
I think so.
Where's Applejack?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Do you have your own room?
Do they let you --
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
LaPlante!
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
Here we go.
You woulda gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it all didja?
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
I got your bail continued.
Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I augment my income a little with some business deals
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
So you can call me naive
You mean John Bubber?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
Bernie, how'sa kid?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
Elliot?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
You!
Turn that thing off.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  what? Blackmailing...?
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more misbehavior on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The Scumbag
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  You've known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
Vietnam!
You were... very... inspiring.
Read it.  It'll be fine.
That's not what I mean...
It's not right, Gale...
You do?
A little mistake!
I'm trying.
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
What about a reward for coming forward?
She wants to quit?
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber has got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
It's not unthinkable.
Did you hear that?
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
This is no good.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
Got a little lucky.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
What?
Good to know you, John.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
Alex!
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of my life.  What was your per-diem?
Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt
We all had our quarrels and parted...
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
My life is not some deal.  I...
Last rites, sister?
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said Polite conversation is rarely either.
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
I'm going to find out.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of watch out
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
Never, why do you ask?
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Could you believe that crazy elephant?
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
I was the Warden?
How long were you in?
I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum.
Oh Hudson...
This is too bad to be false.
Trust Leonardo....
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some neat things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
Bunny, not you too?
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
Bastard, you're going to need another nose!
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
I'm supposed to fall for that?
That smart?!
I'm happy enough.
Lumbago.
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Muncie!
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Hungry, anyway.
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Please! Norville!
...Why don't I just type this up...
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...I'm sorry.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Oh, Norville --
For Pete's sake, Norville!
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Now, Amy --
Huh?!
As a three-dollar bill.
Says who?!
Just got hired today!
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
...You don't?
...It is?
Say, that was a swell idea!
Yes sir...
Yessir.
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
Well, I'm a college graduate --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Well, I made the dean's list.
Not even behind your back?
Get out of my sight.
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Damnit, where's my car!
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Here you go, baby.
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Ugh!
Okay, this is working.
Now.
I have to finish my job --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Didn't hear it.
No.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Still going.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Oh come on --
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
No no...
Oh, tell the story.
And have fun at your bachelor party.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Hey you.
I'm glad you're home.  That alone thing is... not my specialty...
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Do you have something to drink?
Yeah, thanks.
especially One like this.
Yeah, I did.
Good evening.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
What?
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
Easy, easy --
And I appreciate that impulse.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Will you marry me?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Why do you love me?
It's my fault.
I don't know --
I think we made a mistake here.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, responsible... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
What about medical?
At eleven at night? _ 70.
That's the girl I love.
Thanks.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
I got it.
At last I find you.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Rod --
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
Why not?
Uh, not today, but --
I understand your anxiety.
Fine.
How do I know?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
I'm a little worried --
I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
I don't know -- how's dedication for an answer?
You don't want to go home, do you?
I'm asking you a question --
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
That's an answer.
Jerry!  You made it --
Thanks for coming.
Well.  Good luck with that --
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Damn right.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
Cronin's okay for lunch?
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
No.
I'm not your brother!
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Let's go the zoo.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
Funny...   I better go to bed.
Right up ahead, buddy --
I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  are you Ready for the weirdness; the strange perfection And truth of...
Where's ganz?
I don't think you're gonna make it.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the tools of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
A man must eat --  And drink.
What made you think I'd be able to get you into the Castle?
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
What an extraordinary request!
I'll commit that to memory.
... My ... social situation?
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Why would you suppose so?
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
Have you looked?
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
What's funny?
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
Are you free tonight?
And you ...?
Ah -- we're back to the authorities you spoke of.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
Why were you given notice?
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
I told you, they're dead.  It's finished.
-- Listen to me --
Your office is the Workmen's --
What did she say?
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
... Why take me into your confidence?
That's mad.
... A piece of paper ...
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
All these in the last year?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
You're a beautiful woman.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
I need to see his habitat.
I'm trying!!!
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
Everybody out, back to your tents, now!
I do not like you.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of you and it's liberating to say so.
Jesus Christ!!
This could end up saving your life,--
His head was just... bitten off.
This is a setback.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
I can arrest you!!
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he is a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. A grand dragon.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
Where is he?!
Get the gun.
This time, I'm gonna kick your ass.
Where?  Where?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Thank you, Jack.
No.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Are you sure?
Did you want to be killed by it?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Oh, bullshit.
Eh.  Fuck it.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
You're gonna be okay.
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
Never been to Maine before?
I told you.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
So I don't like tents, why--
What?
Who?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
I am not staying on shore.
It's too dangerous for--
I'm sorry but you're...
Good.
He thinks they're what?
You okay?  Kelly?
Yeah.  Nobody saw anything?
That's probably good.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Nice?  Nice would be you look pretty
Why he's that big, I don't know. Why he's here... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Ssssh!
What?
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Really--
No.  I keep getting hit with heads!
What?
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Are we crazy?
It can't work.
Keep firing!
We gotta get to Hector!!
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
You sure?  I don't mind...
Likewise.
Probably not.
White perch.
They look like they're jumping.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
You gotta be kidding.
Where is he?!
He's done.  He's dying.
You too.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
I wouldn't.
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Seconds.  Three, four.
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
You talk to the married couple?
What kind of backup do we have?
You have a thing against museums?
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
We're staying in tents?
Hey!!
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's here... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
They don't believe her.
Apologize?
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
It's to make you understand him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
You like Jack?
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
What was that?
Are you alright?
Are you okay?
Look.
They're coming right in.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Wait.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Kelly.
I had a great time last night. Again.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
It's ten after nine.
Hey.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
It has nothing to do with--
I am not going to Maine.  That's ridiculous.
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Luther was part of the gang?
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
I don't give out the details.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
No.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
I'm sorry, George...
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
Funny?  I dunno.  But intriguing... mindboggling... perhaps headache-inducing... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
What, you don't think I can beat him?
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
I can't move my arm.
You've got good days and bad days.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Oh!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
Right...
No thanks.
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
I can shtop whenever I want...
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
Oh, it's open.
Andy... there is no real you.
You're NOT DYING!
But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
And you're just poor white trash!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
I'm gonna quit.
What?!?
They're asking for it.
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
She'll say, Now my son is a man.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
Yeah, exactly -- was!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the Hallelujah Chorus -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You made that move, huh?
They saved your ass, convict.
Daddy, no!
And I'll have the special fish.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
What?
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
Hi.  Hi.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
You haven't said anything.
I'm getting married.
I didn't give you away the first time.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Yeah.
Let's go tell your Mother.
Mona?
What'd you do to your hair?
You're my father.
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
I'm going to marry him.
Yes. Do you want...
I have no life.
I don't understand.
That's it.
Loretta. What's that smell?
I know that. I do what I want.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
No.
Stupid.
You think so?
You really are stupid, you know that.
What are you doing!
Stop it!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
A bride without a head!
Where are you taking me?
I can't believe what is happening.
Me neither.
I was dead.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
It makes you look like an angel.
Take it easy.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
I can't!
What?
Hi.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Come on.
You're making me feel guilty again.
We're here.
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
No.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.
No, I'll tell him.
Will you marry me.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
Hi Loretta.
Johnny.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
I don't understand.
On the floor?
This is a good suit.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Seven-thirty.
What about the wedding?
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
What?
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Pop.
Will you live here?
I got married before, you didn't sell.
I'm thirty-seven years old.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
And we'll sell the house.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Hi.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
No. Are you drunk?
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
No more he's not.
She recovered.
WHAT!! She was dying!
You gotta date?
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
I know.
I know.
Alright.
Come on in.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
You're kidding?
Who was that?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
No idea.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Have you come to make peace with me?
I'm sure she did.
May I presume to ask you a question?
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
Thanks, comrade.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Then why are you eating alone?
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for you.
I'm freezing
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
Oh.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Cosmo.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Oh. Right.
She's got it.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
Well, who is your lord?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
All right!  What do you want?
Yes ...
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
What?
Then you shall die.
I move for no man.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Come on you pansy!
What?
Had enough?
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Had enough ... ?
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
What?
Well, what are you then?
Now what happens?
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
They're nervous, sire.
What with?
Just keep me covered.
Oh, just some friends!
By what name are you known?
A G...g...g...
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
It is the rabbit.
I warned you!
Oh, shut up.
Charge!
Man!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Well you could say: Dennis
Well ... I AM king.
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Sorry ...
Yes, Lord.
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
Exactly.  So... logically ...
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Look.  I'm warning you.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
What?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Umm, where do you want this?
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
Gee, that is a problem.
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
You want me to move?
Okay, no problem.
So, what's on your mind?
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Great.
Her favorite poet.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Was it a nice funeral?
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Have fun.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
She just had a baby that's all.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
I don't know if I want to.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Never heard of him.
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Reason? What reason?
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Maybe he's wet?
Sure am, who are you?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
I've got something better.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
What are you staring at?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
Rose.
He's writing. Hello?
My mother.
But we made a business deal.
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
I want juice!
Thanks....
TAXI!!!
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Vada.
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
Oh my gosh, here it is!
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
Change my name.
What if you don't wanna be found?
I think it's cool.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
DON'T!!!
Uh oh...
Where are you going???
Owh...
It's dangerous!!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
Really?
Hey look!
Right.
And you'd be my cousin?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Good. I mean...
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
He's an undertaker.
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
This has been a real confusing day.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
Part adventure...part miracle.
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
Muh??
No problem.
Well Rose was being very thorough.
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Maybe.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
Then you'll be all set.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Bye Aunt Rose.
So what's wrong?
I mean...with your car.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Yes, I do.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
They're enormous, I know.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Oh no.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
Shelly?
Did it hurt a lot?
Beidermeyer?
He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
Keep your voice down!
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
I need the job.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Well the other night at dinner...
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
Yeah.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
Want to what?
Kiss me.
Good.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
I'm looking forward to that.
Really?
How's it going chef?
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
VADA!
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Is it for a child?
Dad??
Can I go too?
When?
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
What are you doing.
Yes.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
He's okay isn't he?
Really?
Nothing, I'm dressing.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Hi.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Get away from me!
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
Cause she's dying.
No.
Really?
My Dad was funny?
Yes it is.
Who's winning?
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Maybe black means you're happy?
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
Shut your big fat mouth!
My ball, I lost my ball.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Are you married?
Have you ever tried any?
No.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Aarrggh.
Hi.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
NO!
Yes!!
It's okay sweetheart.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Okay, get in to bed.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Liverpool?
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
Hurry!
I'm trying.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
It's a mosquito bite.
Come on, it's fun.
Hey, where does it say that?
Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.
Heaven.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Don't DO that!!
I am not.
For their meat.
I am running faster!!
But I have my clothes on!
Hi Vada.
Sure.
I wanna live with them too.
They're getting married?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Leave then, some friend you are.
No, I'm hiding out.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Like they do on TV?
For what?
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Stay, huh?
You don't miss much.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
You think...
You're butting in.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
Let's not get carried away.
That was Thursday.
Well, we're...
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
I was gonna predict that.
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
About Michael's job.
Exactly what?
Ex-cuse me?
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
I need you.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
I got the point.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
Big weddings are so strange.
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
The night we met.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Yes.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
It's over.
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
Get married, apparently.
And your point?
Well.  How come she didn't...
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
DON'T SPEAK!
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
I came here, looking for her.
Why would she come here...
It's two weeks.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
Because I could come...
What is that sup...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Yeah, I know.
It is?
û uhh, must have forgotten-
What?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
No Roger from op/ed?
Nope.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
OH! How about Under the Sea?
Well excuse me.
Roger in Op/Ed.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Yeah.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
That is lingerie.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Anita!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Why?
Do I want to be crunched?
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
A--flack jacket.
Hey--I can be out of control.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Have you been there?
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold.  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Oh.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
That is so--weird that you name your car.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your things that make you a better person than me list.
Better person than I.
See!
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
It's just for a couple of months.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Why is that impossible?
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Little known fact.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Better than I...
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
I know.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Sure, why?
Are you--scared?
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You have to say that. You're my student.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
When are you going to open your eyes?
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
What?
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Well, a ball player.
Maybe we should sit.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
What about Luther?
We missed.
Well... a shot at it.
Now you're lying.
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
And then I... right.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
Coffee?
No.
Oh right.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
I brought these, but clearly...
Absolutely fine about it.
Are you busy tonight?
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Ahm...
What did you say?
So who left who?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
Why?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
Your boyfriend?
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
I think goodbye is traditional.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Oh no no -- no.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
You've got big feet.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
You have a stunt bottom?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Wow.
What?
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Who was Gilda?
Stay forever.
Jesus.
You do?
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
This is certainly... ah...
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Yes...
What's your name?
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Tony -- what do you think?
Yes -- sort of...
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Blimey.  What's that?
Well, thanks, that's great.
The others?
Yes?
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
I think you do, yes.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Well?
She's perfect, perfect.
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
So not over her, in fact.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
So -- any messages?
What did she say?
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Which was?
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
And she's in your house.
And you get on very well.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Oh.  Right.
Fabulous.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
You sure that's the reason?
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
We found each other, didn't we?
I'm a liberal!
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
We'll KNOW.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
But Faith--
I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
Where are you going?
To the foot doctor.
He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Do you want me to do it?
NO.
Yeah.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
What?
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
So were you.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  Are you're leaving?
No.  I just came by to apologize.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
Are you asking me out?
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
A little white lie?  A little white lie?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Wait.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
And more...
Excuse me?
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
So what do you think?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
So, what's your point?
Is he gay?
So?...
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
No.  He's never asked me.
But what?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
It's still the new year...
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying.
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
Now what do we do?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Only what?
Your brother?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
What's that supposed to mean?...
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
Oh my God.  Where?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
It was a ouija board, remember?
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Who said I was going?
No.  No, you go ahead.
Peter found him?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
And he is living proof.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
Yes.  He is.
Uh huh.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
I'd love to.
How old are you?
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Right.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
I came after the woman I love.
And you didn't tell her?
That's really romantic.
Ten billion to one.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on tonight, eight-thirty.
I said not as a rule.
You were both in the trunk?  Together?
They didn't tell me anything, they asked questions.
I know a Glenn.
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
You didn't visit him in prison.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
You say you perform in the Miami area?
I'm not dressed.
I don't know where he is.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
She's coming with us.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, Oh
Sounds great.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
He knows where she lives?
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying.  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
Now that's a really big house.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
You know how I felt about her.
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
I don't ski.
Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around.
I'm going back inside.
Jack --
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
It was an unusual experience.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Is that what you would've done?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
All right, but...
But don't you do anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Sure, Daniel.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
That's all I wanted to know.
You get the key?
The manager's door is metal.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
You excited?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
I'll need a last known address.
Oh-kay...
Karen, I told you not to--
Wait, I know him --okay?
Sign says Shut the fuck up.  Or can't you guys read?
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
That's right.
I don't smoke.
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
Not until recently.
A little.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Why, are you famous?
That's funny.
Sure.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
Faye Dunaway.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Peter Finch.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
Yeah...
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
How do we do that?
Because you're having too much fun.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Love it.
It smelled.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
Yeah, but in a nice way.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
You were going to see her?
I don't think we should get into that.
You coming back?
You're not dumb.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
I told you, I'm not going back.
The backseat.
Weren't you expecting us?
She knew me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled.
Yeah?  She said that to you?
I thought you guys were busted.
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
I know what you're talking about.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
How, Dick?  The way you earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you were nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying sign in here please or hey
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
Meaning?
You busted out?
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
There were others.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
You don't remember me, do you?
But you're sure we've met, huh?
What am I supposed to do now?
No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
And is Foley a part of this?
Why's that?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Gee, I wonder why not.
I'm freezing my ass off.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Uh-huh.
Gimme another hint.
It's Richard Ripley.
What?
Me?
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
What-- when?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is my job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
Oh...
You're a fighter?
No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Your dog was killed?
Something better.  Open it.
It's a --
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Technically.  They're separated.
He's about to.
No thanks.
Dad...
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
We don't get to talk much any more.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
Hey, yourself.
He doesn't even look like that.
Was it Foley?
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
It's late, they're closing...
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
So?
My little girl, the tough babe.
Likewise.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, Undercover?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Faux goose down.
Still...
Are those my suits?
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Where the fuck is Foley?
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
I don't get it.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
Just what you underlined.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Charlie really has a great voice.
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
And we're here on the couch...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
They'll learn to live with it.
Would you?
Thanks.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Charlie, how are you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
What am I going to do with you?
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
That's real big of you.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
You're going to listen to me.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, Peggy
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
It opens, too. Look inside.
I know.
What the hell is that?
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
I'm trying.
I thought you were...for a while.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
Test?
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
I wish she hadn't.
Don't get your hopes up.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Is that one of your poems?
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
It's Charlie!
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I closed my Christmas club.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
Rosalie Testa!
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
You look exactly the same.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Dancing with you.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
What's that?
I	know what a burrito is.
What's inside?
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Am I dead or not?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyùfifty.
Sixtyùforty.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Will you take of f your blouse?
I couldn't help it ùù I loved him.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Did you break up with Charlie?
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
You okay?
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
He's not really my uncle.
Twenty-five percent.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Yes.
No, you look like a hooker.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
What motel you staying at?
What's your name?
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
I never joke about money.
What?
Off the boulevard.
Exactly.
Always.
Let's talk some more first.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Uh-huh.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Try a strawberry.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
By breaking up a company's assets --
Vivian --
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Five full nights... days too?
But you want days too.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
Hello?
You're forgiven.
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
I have work to do.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
Shall we mingle?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Do I look okay?
What if someone tries to steal it?
What happened to him?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I know.  I'm glad.
Did you?
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
Business.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
My what?
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Love this car!  Is it new?
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
Edward, did you hear me?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
Did I wake you?
Have you lost your mind?
Yes.
Carlos had some great rock.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
What do you know?  You look good. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
You sure you won't come with me?
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
You bullshittin' me?
What?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Vivian.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
What if they serve soup?
But what if they serve soup?
Steak spoon!
Professionally?
Me?
Hi, Barney!
Yes.  Something... conservative.
What is with you?
'Scume me.
I think it's great.
Get out!
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
He will come for me.
Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
Who are you?
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
What? -- go on --
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
We did it.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? Gently?
What?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
I'm waiting!
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
What do I do?
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Yes, some of the time.
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
I don't think more than ten.
where?
But you don't know where he is.
Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
Inigo.
I brought you a special present.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Because I can stop now if you want.
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
No.  To the pain.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Now?
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
Sir. Sir.
Humiliations galore!
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
You are ready, then?
Begin!
Making sure nobody's following us.
That would be inconceivable.
You know what a hurry we're in.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
I will. And I choose --
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
To my honey I'll croon,
Honeymoon,
Keep a shining in...
Yes sir.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
Assume away!
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
One night.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
How's this?
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
I already have.  Come on.
Where would you like to eat?
Coney Island??
Then stick with Bialystock!
Maybe you're happy.
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
You found a flop!
A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
What are you doing?
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Only if we ask him.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
What???
What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt?
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  Oh
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Yes.
Vat about it?
With whom?
We swear it!
Yes.  We would!
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Come on.  Let's get going.
Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
Do it!  Do it!
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Nice girl.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
All right.  All right.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Like clockwork.
Ta.  Ta.
By the sacred memory...
The Graf Spee...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
OH.  I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
Yeah.
The key!
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
The key, goddamit, the key!
Oh, God...
It didn't go off.
Doolittle, are you there?
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Armed.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
Of course.
It is intuitively obvious.
Why don't you have more time?
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Yes, well...
...nine seconds...
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Out where?
Ah, negative drop.
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
What happened, Doolittle?
Certainly not!
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
On my mother's grave.
No kidding?
Yeah?
I was telling the truth.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
He might be.  I don't know.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Yes.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes Brad.
Uh huh.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What was that, Doolittle?
That's correct, sir.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
We must have a blow-out.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
Oh....Say something.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry.
Weiss.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
Maybe we could try it this way.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Commander? Are you still there?
Sir?
Talk to the bomb.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Promise you won't tell Brad.
What a guy
Smile and that will mean I may
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Oh.
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
It's all yours.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What's that comin' from the bar?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
They?
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Surprised?
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
How did you get onto Doom?
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
He made me laugh.
Doom.
Here's the problem...  Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
I got him on loan from Disney.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
Stop what?
That was the idea.
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
Divorce?  Never!
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
Yeah, that's better.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
My brother.  Get inside.
Get away from there.
Forget it.
Two bits.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
No, kid, you're a real hero.
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
From this box here...
Get out!
All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
So what's your story?
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
That's right.
No.  It's my first time.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Those girls drove off because of you.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
No.
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
And you ain't black!
You.
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
No.  She's a school teacher.
Good at what?
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
You said --
Follow the Rich White Man?
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
How do you know?
Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
What?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
What is it?
Wait!  There's people down there!
It's a bomb.
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
She never even looked at you.
Are you okay?
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
See you in the next world.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
No mu-shu.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
No problem.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
This money is evidence.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
I could use a little vacation.
What revenge is he talking about?
I need your help.
Just trying to make it look real.
Why don't you go get them?
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
How do I know I can trust you?
Dip me!
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Any leads?
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
You know what a phone booth is?!
And that, of course, would be me.
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Help me Rhonda.
You speak English!
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
That silly-ass look on your face.
Where were we?
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
I know a shortcut.
The license!  You get it?!
Did you make the plate?!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
Don't go there...
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Come on!
It happens.
You like it?
That's not how it goes.
Which one?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
What do you hear?
Where'd you get it?
You're killin' me here.
What's wrong with that?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Jesus...what do you want?
You OK?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
How much they want?
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got îem.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
I'm not running.
Of course.
He's here!... He's here!
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Make the shot.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
Paid vindication  That's what I call justice.
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Then you'll be my best man.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
No, I'm not.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
And you are?
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Getting nervous?
Yes.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to poor bastard number four that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
How romantic.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
A pre-wedding luau?
Give me that!
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Seven-fifty.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
Highly suspect.
Bob will be very happy.
Of course.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is King of Blue!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
It's fun!  It's high.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
Really?
Well, you do have the dress.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
Does it matter?
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
You were not.
She's the boss.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
It's probably because you got him fired.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Yes.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
I'm going to kill myself.
Why?
Because you think I'm all like... Hey man
No, I don't think you're like, I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you.  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
But I'm weird.
Lighten up, what?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Would it?
He's going to be the pastor?
What happened at the luau?
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
You okay?  I'm closing.
Quick.  Very quick.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
You don't love me, is that it?
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
Am I what they had in mind?
I love you.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Go to the Symphony --
Does it have wheat in it?
I don't think so.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
That doesn't make any sense.
Okay, okay.
it was a betrayal.
I told you.  Nothing --
I think that's what I'm saying.
You okay?
What's with you?
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
Not.
You're a basket case.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
What?
I want to meet you...
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says vacant-occupied
No.
Yes.
Listen to this, I love this part --
Men never get this movie.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Did you talk to him?
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
What?
Is this crazy?
I love you, too.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
This is a photo of hair.
What about the letter?
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  Sleepless in Seattle is history.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Please --
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
Howard.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
It's probably just the flowers --
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
What?
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Sure you do.
Hello.
It's you.
The cabinets have to be redone --
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
It's hard to imagine.
It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Dad, could you close the door?
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
But how am I going to get there?
Dad --
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
It's never happening again. Right?
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
You're right.  You better hope so.
Dad --
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Sure.  Looking good.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
-- a slice of pizza --
I'm starting to notice that.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Good.
Listen to this --
Not now, Jonah --
It's a sign.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Why is she bringing that bag?
Jonah!
Okay.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
What are you doing up?
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Victoria? She's okay.
It might be in the kitchen.
Yes.
Shut up.
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
When I found you?
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
It was all they had.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Do you like baseball?
Hi.
You look good.
It takes time --
No, I mean... you love your son?
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Right, slow...
What'd you do?
I guess he got the message...
Hey, you know what I really think?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Namely?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
Pardon me?
No, no he's not.
Hey, sis.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
No, no, don't go in there.
I'll be home soon.
That's not even a scam.
Yes.
I admit nothing.
What does it say?
Read it.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
I don't feel anything.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
What?
I won?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Goodnight.
Dad.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I'm fine.
Swear to god.
I'm so ashamed dad.
This is me telling you about me.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.  What a day.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Busy?
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
What are these?
Thank-you.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
What?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Yeah?
I think you should wear that.
Mmmm.
Oh.
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay.
It's okay, everybody does that.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.  With potential.
Friends with potential.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah?
Right.
Okay, this is important...
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Yeah.
This is so noble.
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
What's wrong?
You need to study?
Yeah, uh-huh.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
No, I don't, I don't.
Did you talk to Corey?
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Then don't do it.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
I know
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
No way.
You know Diane Court?
I don't know.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Sunday, but...
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
The paint!
Uh... dudes?
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
I think we should try sneaking in.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Call me later.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Check.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
It was stolen!
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Great place for lunch.
Mom, what're we...?
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
Jack, are you okay?
What?
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Not if I shoot first!
Mercutio
Oh
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
When I have fifty pounds.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Romeo
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
On my mother's side the Ardens
Who is that?
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
I have a wonderful new play!
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Is it going well?
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
It is over.
it will be all right, madam.
Who are you?
Thomas Kent!
Do you know it?
As soon as I have found my muse
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Who wrote that?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Where are you going?
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
Romeo.
We are lost.
Go on.
The daughter of his enemy.
I will.
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Luck be with you, Sam.  Samà?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
I like her.
But the plague
Who are you, master?
I'll be damned if you are!
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
Oh
Mr. Henslowe?
Oh--no, no!
There is time. It is still dark.
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
Will you read it for me?
àthou need'st not to be gone.
I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
Orsinoàgood name
But all ends well.
How does it?
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
You flatter, my lord.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
But why me?
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
I will do my duty, my lord.
Good morning, my lord!
I am going to church.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Your name?
Take off your hat.
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
Is there a man?
A man, my lord?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
I was trying to educate you.
What?
Will you shut up and play.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
Jack?  What was that?
About what?
I don't have time.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
Can I show you something?
No.
No.
Juliet?
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Don't you worry about that.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
What's the problem?
After.
You think so?
I don't know.
You're sure? There's lots more.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're not eating.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
Cover it?
I don't know.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
I don't know them.
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
Yes.
What?
And you like it?
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
I thought you stopped going.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
For the flat.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
Well, she had problems --
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
-- which is --
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
So?
Yes.
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
What are you doing?
What?
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
David?
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Stop nagging.
No, I don't.
Who was it?
No.
Then let's spend some money.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
We have to talk.
Now you thought of that, not me.
I refuse.
Are you all right?
That's what I thought he said.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
It's OK. There's no problem.
You mean I can have the room?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Downstairs.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
Of course.
Who said there were four?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Do you smoke?
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Did you ever kill a man?
Jack, wait...
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Is this what they always look like?
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Would you like to talk about it?
No.
Yes. They're my friends.
That's what it cost, David.
Expecting anyone?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
No one.
Eh, I don't know.
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
Right here?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
You must be Juliet.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
For what?
And that's not the same thing?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
The first one was fine.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
I suppose so.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Your watch.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
You betcha.
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
I know.  It's ancient.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
Is there any syrup?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Van Cartier.
You re okay -- for a civilian.
JUST SING!
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
I... I...
Three years.  Sister.
You have to help me
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
What?
Mary Clarence!
Oh my Lord!
He always have that shit-eating grin?
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Your name?
Enough joking.
Miss Van Cartier.
And all those like you.
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
The vow of obedience.
And the vow of chastity.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Your cell.  Your room.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
And whom would you call?
Come, Sister.
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  No pain
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
You have a phone call.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
No nothing.
Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
Pray.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
We could put you into our witness protection program.
Get her!
There she is!
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
We're losing it.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
We've got to save her!
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Yes?
He's kind.
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
Not a note.
But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
You're what?!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Really, Loretta?
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Who the hell are you?
Thank God for bunge cords.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
American literature. What else?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a personal consultation with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
For me?  I'll have the same thing.
What's the difference?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Are you closed?
It's yours?
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
They're all the same.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
He's crazy.
No, he's not. You are.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing, is there?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Hi, Auggie.
Two, right?
You usually get two.
I gotta work with these women.
So. Are we ready?
Ready. Any time you are.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Like what?
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Yeah, like what?
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
Still, you can't just write her off.
For keeps.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
Open it.
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
And you told your nephew about it?
I figured he had a right to know.
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Your parents'd kill you.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
Well, if you put it that way...
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
Here and there. Around.
I didn't expect to see you again.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Eight-thirty.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.
Hey, it's you.
I don't have much time.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
You work too hard, you know that?
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
No way.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
His only copy?
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
It wasn't my fault.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Yes, please.
I'm gonna need more caps.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Ow!
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
That's it, I'm goin'...
We was robbed.
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Beat it, Buster.
What're you doin' here?
Fresh!
A what?
It's private.  Go away.
Manhattans?  This time of night?
What did he say?
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
Where were you guys?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Hey, Joe!
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
With me?
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
You mean it's a girls' band?
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
My name is Josephine.
Polish?
Bitch!
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
Me?  After Sugar?
You - you -
Here, I didn't get any.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
What message?  What motorboat?
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
And where's he going to be?
Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
I'll say there is!
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
That's some nerve!
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
What?
Shut up and keep packing.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
OH!
That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
I'm Sugar Cane.
She sings, too.
Hi.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Anything wrong?
And your head is hot.
And you've got cold feet.
What did you say?
You got some?
Half-full.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
We better have a drink first.
Here you are, Sugar.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Come on, Daphne.
Josephine -
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Yes.  For a whole year.
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Bye.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
You're not sure?
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
We can have it altered.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Why not?
Oh, naw. Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Oh, no!
What's the job?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Loretta, shut it.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
Yes, we're the new girls.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Most smartest? Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. Most smartest. We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
Oh.
We understand.
Better keep a lookout.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Afford it?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of Come to Me My Melancholy Baby - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
That so?
You know - I play tenor sax.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Yeah.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
You are?
About what?
I want mine to wear glasses.
They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
Want to switch berths with me?
Would you mind terribly?
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
I'll be right back. See ya later.
What makes you so sure?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Your view of what?
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
How's the stock market?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
Why?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Oh?
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
They repealed Prohibition?
One of whom?
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
You heard her - yes.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Three?
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
I don't mind if I do.
What's on Thursdays?
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Harmless - how?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
What else is there for me?
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
All right - if you insist.
I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
I knew you would.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
I didn't do anything.  It just happened.
Goodbye, my darling.
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
They told me to practice.
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
We got different information.
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
You and who else?
Okay, Charlie.
Hey.
Sure, disappear. WeÆve been walking away our whole lives.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
MomÆs refining her strategy for DDay.
Sir, yes, sir!
IÆd be happy to. YouÆre welcome.
Mom, please.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
Hey.
Hey, Kat.
That was a long time ago.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
When we were together I was ôtoo here,ö now IÆm not here enough.
Bollocks, IÆm sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. ItÆs no big deal. I promise.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
Kat.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Love.
ItÆs okay. Hell, IÆve never paid for it. But please donÆt feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
ItÆs cute.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
I think thatÆs disgusting.
ThatÆs right. Imagine facing it alone.
Sorry. IÆm a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Your ôfriendö guaranteed my anonymity.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Shampoo, got it!
Oh, no.
First of all, itÆs never out of the blue. And second of all--
When youÆre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Subtle?
Are you sure?
So youÆre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? ThatÆs a down payment on a Ford Focus!
Not dollars. Pounds.
And what if I didnÆt want you to...to do that to me?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
ItÆs my job.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Yeah. You?
YouÆre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Hi.
You didnÆt have to do that.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Doggy.
And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!
I saw him last night!
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
Okay.
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
Yeah,  Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
I can't believe he's dead.
What?
Come on, just get to the message board!
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
Cartman?!
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
You've got a stupid accent too.
Look at that!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Then move out of the way.
Aw, ma!!
Dude, what the hell is going on?
I'll have to enclose the check first.
What's the password?
Yeah, I guess.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Here I am, Father...
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
We can't leave without you!
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...
Nowhere.
It isn't fair!
Our moms suck!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
About - thirty-four seconds.
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!
I'll just try the first one.
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Sweet.
Thank you, Kenny.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
I am the dark master!
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
I sure did, Phillip!!
Yes -- why?
Fight the power!
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
I know, Terrance. I know.
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
I know.
So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I do. I want you to respect my MIND.
What if I just left?
No! It can't be!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Yeah!
Wendy?
He only weighs ten ounces --
My friend the clitoris told me.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
Cool!
Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for
What is it?
We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days.  Dry up into crunchy little pinkies.
Got it.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
What other job you got?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
How'm I doing, boss?
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
It must be done right away.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
$50?
You upstart!
Yes.
Was it -- swine?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Your Excellency!
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
You bet your life.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
It's about life.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
As the Old Mill goes around...
Surest thing you know.
What are you doing?  I love your script.
The Firehouse...
Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
You can do it.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
I used to go out with a politician.
What's the scene...
I hurt you?
Hi.
Going home.
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
Press still works.
That's something a man could do...?
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Yes...
Now you're talking...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
...you think that's right...
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll be waiting.
Morning, darling.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a commodity than...than our...
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
That's so beautiful...
I have to tell you something...
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
I'm sorry.
Who is this person that you've found?
He works on the movie.
I'm sorry.
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a very good play.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this Bimbo you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' donkey act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
And I need a drink.
Because, because...we don't have to build an Old Mill -- they have an Old Mill -- yeah.  It's on a stream -- that's where you put a mill.
How big is this horse?
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It says here...  Are we together on this?  Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
It's...
Mornin, sister.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
She's a...
What I...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking horse dies.  You know, she could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, wife...?  It could be his...
Bobby...
So you see what I'm saying...the movie is about purity...
I've always seen that.
You mind...?
I'm ready!
You do...?
I just don't know what order they come in...
Izzat so?
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  My thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars to do what you're being paid to, you already signed you'd do...?  What is that?
I really think that business...matters should be discussed between you t...
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
I'm not a child... I have feelings... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
Oh.
...we had a script conference...
I just...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Yes, but, Joe, Joe's been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, Thoughts
Yeah.
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the thoughts you've been...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
Who are these from?
...she has a home...
He treated me as if I were a child...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't tell you...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Marty...
You show Claire these sketches?
Did she throw up?
Why not?
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
This young woman.
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
Gut Yuntif.
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
Oh, that's great.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
Halo?  Marty?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
Why?
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
I don't getcha.
No, what is it?
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played Medea?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first wife...
...would you excuse me, please...
How do they know that, you told them?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
What is that...?
You cool the broad out?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over sheep...
That's what I said.
Like dykes and dogs.
It's just a formality.
Pay her off.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Is that one hell of a kid?
Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
George, that is so kind of you.
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the film is in that shot.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
That will never happen.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
Like a big sister.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
Actually.  I could only help him.
Good girl.
Don't. Take me with you.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You touched it.
No!
Doo-wop-doo-doo, doo-wop-doo-doo...
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do big spaghetti.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
Where are you, anyway?
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
So you're okay.
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
That's Rache's song!
Where Ben?
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
How do you know?
You dying.
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Are you here?
I'm here.
We're not discussing your age.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Jackie, she was five minutes late --
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Our children.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
We...
It's temporary.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Machines do not EAT message.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Anxiety.
Yes?
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
My boss.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
You are marrying the greatest guy who walks this earth.  Who I have loved from my heart for twelveyears!
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
Thanks, but it's under control.
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Well, maybe your version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
Doing the right thing.  Knowing who you are, inside.  Not caving to peer pressure, or lowering yourself to that level, steering your own course...
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
I lost him.  I was panicked.
What do I have that you don't?
You're the hip and fresh.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
They don't hate you --
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
It's forever you know.
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Four brothers and five sisters.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
I did not go to high school.
We had to work. My family was poor.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Mi Jesusàmi jesusà
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
My Jesusà
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
Jesus was not bad.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
We're not ready.
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Mom?
We did the same thing last year also.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
I can read it to you.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Fuck!
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
The same.
OK.
OK!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
No, not really.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Toby Oxman.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Great. How old are they?
Is it loaded?
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
You should be.
You want some?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Thanks man.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Oh.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
We are?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Yeah.
In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
It was pretty bad, huh?
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
That was really great.
Right! Where is he?
Uh-huh.
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
Typical male.
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Yup.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Okay, whatever you want.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out. My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
It's your birthday?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
Yes!
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Sorry.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
You know what we should do? Go to the...
No, no.
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
I know, man.
You know?
What, they're looking for her?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Y- s-sure it did.
Buff...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Yeah, man.
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Guess not.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Yeah, right, publicist.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Really?
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Oh, Pony's band Dream Girls? Been on the road opening for Midnight Hore. Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Hey, man.
Am I fucking him?
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
I can come visit?
I will.
Score! Yeah!
He paid you man.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Oh, So what about her?
Yeah, we're all above that.
Please.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
No, no, whoa!
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Hey, thanks, man.
Thanks. See man?
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
WHAT did you say?
WELCOME?
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Yeah, totally.  So, uh, what do they interview you about?
You rich?
He is?
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Mm-mm.
Really?
Mm.
You cut off your little finger?
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Let's see.
I'm not a nice guy.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
How d'you KNOW we're friends?
Oh, sure.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, wow.
Pony and I are friends.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
What?
Tim, what are you talking about?
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
You lied to me.
Oh, shit.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Jeff! Come up here!
Come on!
Look, your trespassing.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Nazeer Chaudry!
Look, look, just get off my property.
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
It's a piece.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Can I talk?
Okay, what would you have done.
I would've stopped it.
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
What feelings?
Of course.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Mm-hm.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Yes, you do.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Five this week; how many the week before?
And the week before that?
Do your covers and all that shit.
Just go.
Yeah.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
So how's college?
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Like songs?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
But, Erik...
What do you mean?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Burnfield. No place like it.
I don't know.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
No, this has everything to do with you.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
No, she was just sitting there?!
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
New York, huh?
You do not!
Hey.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Alright, alright already.
Alright!
Mine too.
Yep.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Is that Jeff?
Oh, my god!
Don't write any checks you can't cash.
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Where do you get your ideas?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
It's none of my business?
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: Don't write any checks you can't cash.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
No.
... so when your dad said, I never want to see your f-'in' faces again! do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Oh, Jack...
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
Madonna.
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Yeah, hold on.
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Hello?
Hannah, we've...
Yeah.  Itchy sent us.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched Dog Day Afternoon!
Bank branch!
My what?
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
What the hell do you want?
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
How?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
I'm sure it's lovely.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Is there something the matter with it?
Yes... oh, yes...
Sh!
You don't love ME.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
What -- rape?
I don't suppose... no...
You DON'T like it, do you?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Scream.
You told them I raped you -- why?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Brad?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Well... no...
Clark.
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  Would you dance with me?
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
You...um...you never got married?
Oh...I came close once.
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Is THAT Odin?
Odin!
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher.
Call me.
Uh-huh.
Well, aren't you excited?
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Uh...excuse me, folks...
You're the best, Lois.
But what?
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce! Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
I know, I'm the fault.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
Yeah. A raise . .
Say what?
Say who?
Or socks.
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Black or regular?
Which country?
Columbia.
Columbia.
Wipe 'em out?
Hey, boss.
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
We've already got some.
Anything.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
You want to mess with Superman?
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
We gonna crash?
It saved my father!
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
I know, by computers.
Ricky?  Where...what...
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
But the bridge...
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
I don't kiss.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Don't cry, Bubba.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
So?
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
What's it all about?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
Slower! In... Out...
What are YOU doing here?
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
The sun! That's it!
What magic?
But you're the Gods!
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Now stop it!
Well, come on!
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
What's the matter with Bjorn?
What do you think?
But HOW?
Look, I bagged it last week.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
We haven't got a spare place.
ROW!
DEATH!
Hy-Brasil?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Over the Edge of the World.
What do we have to do?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
What?
My brother blacksmiths!
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Wasn't it, Keitel?
YOU do it!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
I'm drowning! Help!
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
Made by YOU, Loki!
It's not my business any more!
It's a tradition.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
So did my father and his father before him.
I must only let the red rage...
Stop it!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
There is nothing we can do...
And his you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper...
Dad!
I hate you! I hate you!
Well... I'm game.
He seems like he thrives on danger
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Yeah, no kidding.
So, now what?
Sure. Why not.
What was that!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Oh!
Mordechai?
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
I forgive you.
Mordechai!
You two know each other?
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
Cool. What's it do?
Take a look.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Hammer, you alright?
What's your shpiel, Santa?
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
Which one?
Yes sir.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
I can talk, can't I?
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know.
I'll take him anyway.
We'll get by without 'em.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
I know who you are.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
And?
He threatened to kill me.
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
That's why he won't know it.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
What's the problem?
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Raise 500.
See and raise five.
Raise 300.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
The name is Lonnegan.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Who are you?
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
I'll square it with the fixer.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
The Clock People?
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
Where you goin'?
I don't know.  Depends what train I get on.
What time you get off work here?
You doin' anything tonight?
You got a back door to this place?
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
What does this guy want?
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
I feel lucky tonight.
Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
Give 'em a little time.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
How am I gonna do that?
You got nothin' on me.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
Easy come, easy go.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just around the corner.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
You better take a drink.
Another young man.
Well!
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
Why not?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
Don't.  It's horrible.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
You hand that over to the police.
Oh!
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
He wouldn't say.
You know, we know each other.
Yes.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Which way did she fall?
She... she fell over backwards.
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Where did you get this gun?
He's been dead for three months.
You see how much we have to say.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
If you think it'll be all right.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
How's your brother?
Only in bad weather.
What's he want of you?
What's that to you?
Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
Extraordinarily lucky.
What're you doing here?
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
About...
Why yes.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
Why, you said...
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
That's all right.
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
You're always teasing.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
But he has nothing to do with it!
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
You did... where?
I didn't knock Julia off.
All right - you didn't.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Listen.  Studsy Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Why do you say that?
What am I?  The fall guy?
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
What hit me?
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Isn't that my drink?
What are you going to do with it?
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
That's jolly.
Maybe a drink would help you.
Maybe it would if I took it.
They were kidding you.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
At breakfast.
Breakfast.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
I'll get some towels.
Who's that?
Did I give it to you?
Yes.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Maybe I will.
Why don't you?
Catch me letting you go alone!
He's just been for a walk.
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You dog!
Goodbye, darling.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Huh?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
The suspects!  They won't come.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Trying to put it off on her?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Was he a good detective?
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
What's it say?
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
What are we going to do!?
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
What do you figure it to be?
You ready?
I was a successful model once.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
You got no reason to do that!
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
I told you; don't push me around.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
We're at war.
It's a combat action.
But Countess...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
I don't know anything about it.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
It's a container.  Break the seal.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
How the hell should I know how much?
Oh, God!
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
I thought we were dead.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
How long we going to keep this up.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
All last night he could have been--
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
In a moment.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going.
Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.
You've never been in Constantinople?
All kinds.
I want to see--
And as for you, waiter--
Um-hum ...
Just a second.
Two weeks and three days.
Um-hum!
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
I've got to see you.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Then why didn't you call the police? Why don't you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
M'sieu Monescu!
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Now just a minute, Major--
The tennis player?
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Thank you.
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ...
Monescu!
Gaston Monescu.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
The six--
Two fifty-three, five--
Seven and nine!
No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're broke--all right. I might pick up a million-franc necklace. But in times like these when we're doing a cash business--why take a chance on jewelry?
Five, seven, and nine--
He recognized you!
Auf wiedersehn.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
Now, Lily--
Lily, you must listen to me.
Lily!
Then you go into the foyer.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Not particularly.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
What's wrong now?
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Peaches and cream.
Yes.
Make it out to cash!
This used to be my secretary's room.
That sounds sensible.
And how I handle my money!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Madame.
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Hair?
You would?
So you think you can get me?
Now, let me tell you--
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph J. Giron.
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.
Giron...!
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to--
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Two lumps, madame?
May I?
About what?
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Well--uh--yes and no.
Yes, madame?
I don't want your money!
Then why did you do it?
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
Sure!
That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
I can explain--
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Oh--a hundred times--
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Good afternoon--
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
I don't understand.
Where's Lother?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Get moving--
We'll be expecting you.
Not at all.
How about a little game later?
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a rough voyage.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --Honest Jack! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
I could stand some more--
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
No! Don't touch it! I want the world to see my shame.
Where have you been hiding?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Oh, yes, I am, because afterwards--up here in the moonlight.
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
You are a lunatic!
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Yes?
Well, I can't.
Sooner it you like.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
A little.
Thanks.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
You said it! How about a little action?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Good night, idiot!
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Shortie, look!
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
My change.
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred.
No--not quite.
I'm going to the show--
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Swell!
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?
Hello, young fellow!
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see her get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're too smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Here's your fifty.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
O.K. Heads you win.
That's too bad.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but that would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live my life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin hers--Do I make myself clear?
How?
O.K.! Send that!
Pretty good--thirty miles an hour--
No. Knots!
I can see you're no gentleman--
That's me!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Miss Marsh.
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Am I a member of this club?
Just what the doctor ordered.
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
You don't shoot squirrels.
What's he got that I haven't got?
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
He's all right.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
Good night!
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
I sincerely hope so--
Why should I kill him?
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Smooth's the word.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
I was in his cabin--
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
Can I bring some toys?
He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
Bye, house.
Woody!  Buzz!
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Toy?
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
Excuse me.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
No, you can't.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
You actually think you're THE Buzz Lightyear? Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
Then we've no time to lose!!
Right?  Buddy?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Well, then let's climb abroad.
Sorry.
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
Spaceship.
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
But why would Andy want me?
Woody!  It's the moving van.
What?!
Hold on, Woody!
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
Look out!!
Woody!  The rocket!
The match!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Nothing.
There.
Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
This is ludicrous.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Her favorite uncle
You got something on your mind?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
Don't touch her. Call 911.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
What?
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
I don't have to...
She's dead.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Go home!
I'm not getting a ticket.
Don't even start.
More.
Just stop.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
Have you ever done this before?
Wait. Wait a minute.
How do you figure?
We have to get going.
I am not flexible on this.
What does that mean?
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They won't figure it out.
They're driving me nuts!
That's one idea.
Real times.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
Don't eyeball your kids.
If anything ever happens to me...
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Lois please.
That's right.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Your investment ideas never work out.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
What's goosed?
Give me two more.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
Oh God. This is insane.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
Shut up Boyd.
Easy Boyd.
What is the question you asked me?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
What?
Regarding what?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Now?
Isn't it a little late?
My what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
You're sick.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
I never heard that.
Moore?
Oh really? Starbucks?
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
Yup.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
What?
He is.
Who else?
Time out.
Honey I don't have the time...
We're leaving in three hours.
What are you doing?
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Move the bodies?
But...
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
About what?
I just want her to be happy.
Go for it.
I don't hear it.
Have another drink.
What is it?
That ought to be about the end of that.
Yup.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
A move?
My God...
You alright?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping Immaculate Reception? I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I guess.
There.
Where?
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
Yup.
What about it?
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
...can we have a white one...?
Mr. President, this is St...
He, uh, has he been in the jail long?
IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
What are you talking about?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
We're going to have to explain away the...
What crisis?
One day, Two days?  Course it's gonna hhhh....
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to distract them for two weeks til the election.
What in the world would do that?
It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
Twenty thousand dollars.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
....we landing?
We can't afford a war.
What's it gonna cost?
Who would find out?
Who's gonna tell'em.
Who?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  No mention of the Girlscout. None.
Anything at the Airport?
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
How long you been up, you need a nap.
We're gonna do the Team Song.
...Stanley Moss...
Brazen it through?  Brazen it through?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the laundry --- do you know what we've ddd...
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription medication, the side-effects of which...
What are we gonna do about it...?
What are we going to do?
First of all, we're locked in to it, secondly:
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ...Custody...
...child at the airport...  breaks through the ranks, runs to old shoe -- should we have flower or a bear...?
Never quit a winner.
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at all...
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison...
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Out in Oklahoma.
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
My name is Ronald Brean.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There is no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, Geez
What do you want the kid to say?
What do you think would hold it off?
Who?
How the fuck do we know.  You take my point?
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks.
W...what?
...we get our hands on him?
Mmm...
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
We were the Albanian campaign, John -- We Were There.
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  Isn't he...
You've got something, there...
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a prescription here, I'm going to give you the number, I need you standing by with a crate of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
You got a dime....?
They'll be here in ten minutes.
What're you doing?
But you always knew you couldn't take the credit....
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Something happened to them, mon.
On the ledge?
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Hey-yo.
I take out the garbage.
They're not home yet.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Where did you hear that?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I didn't say that.
But your face did!
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Okay, Dennis.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
I don't know.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Are you really a virgin?
You're a really good kisser.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
You first.
What? Are you all right?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
All right, I take it back.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Hey, Rat.
Ace the jacket.
Yo.
Mark. What happened to your date?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
Whatever you say, Rat.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Totally.
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
You told me that part already.
My disguise.  And here...
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
All that jumping and kicking.
Jim, are you all right?
Thank you.
Know what this is?
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was damnably hot.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Just be glad you're all right.
Of course not.
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
How's it going.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
If I didn't have a fiancÚ in Chicago, I'd go for it.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Well I never did it.
There's nothing to it.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Not since November.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Yeah, like maybe never.
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
Mr. Spicoli?
That's the name they gave me.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
All right! Oh, yeah!
Are you all right?
Not at all.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
I'd like that.
What?
Still happy you married me?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
You have your tickets?
I hope you like large weddings.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Surprised?
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
But, sir...
But your grandfather's work, sir...
There wolf!  There castle!
Home!
What?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Was he any good?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
What?
You can't win 'em all.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
But who was playing it?
Right here?
I thought it was wonderful.
It wasn't me.
What are you going to do?
Me?  Sing?
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I think so.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Yes, I will.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
How do you know they're done?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
You know where it is?
We'll meet in three hours?
We're going to get my little girl.
Where is everyone?
With what just happened upstairs --
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
And that's how I ended up here.
Where's the tunnel?
Just move!
Anyone else?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
How much I got, what?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He only shot you once.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Fully.
Two.
Open?
Covered.
Nine?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Let's go.
That's fine.
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Right.
Her name is Charlie.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
We should stick together out there.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
You're sweet.
What 're you talking about?
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Thanks.
Open.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
I won't and nothing you say-
Leadership....
Just!?
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Must be some sort of mining facility.
Nothing.
Purple skinned monstrosity...?
I was staying in character.  Egomaniacal sonofabitch?
I had the shot...
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
Not again...
What the hell is going on?!!?
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
Shut up.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
He's a miserable twit!
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Yes you did.
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Okay...  Okay, now what.
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
Wait two seconds then go.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
We're getting major structural damage.
We need another one.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
All right. Put me back on with him.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying activate turbo boosters, right?...
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
Tell them? About...
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Can it be repaired?
You're playing your good side.
Clenched jaw...
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
Right.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Unbelievable.
You should have let me hit him.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
I... certainly, but-
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Commander?... Where are you... going?
Yeah. Earth. Time to get back to Earth
Thanks
... Maintenance facility...
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
She kissed me.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
But...Why?
You can oc that?
And determination.
Wh... Where are we?
I think we're going to exit the space port.
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
It's as far as it goes!
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
What kind of signal?
Okay... On what?
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
It doesn't have eyes.
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
I reserved a Cadillac.
So where's the money?
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
No. What's this?
We'll get it later.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
You spotted them, huh?
Not too bad.
What's this movie you're doing first?
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?
What about her?
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
You know how to write one of these?
That's all there is to it, huh?
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
Three.
She can't talk right now.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
You know Laurel Canyon?
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
I can't do it.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
C-18.
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
Hello? You there?
Who?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Look at me, Ray.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Why would I do that?
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
He owes me money.
I'm in the movie business.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Where you been, Harry?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
You just did.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
The shylock's the good guy.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
Part of it, yeah.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Ever shot anybody.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
Who's the star?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
Just a thought.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
His shrink's trainer.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
Here's your keys, Harry.
Who?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
He died.
It was in the Herald.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
So you want to know.
One we're producing.
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
I'm looking at you.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Compass.
Whatta you think, Chill?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Here's another tip...
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
You saw that one?
For any movie.
Man, can you scream.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, Cabin in the...
Cotton.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Don't go out of your way.
I just caught the end.
Not yet.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
There a part in it for you?
Sounds fair.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
Really.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Oh.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
You sure?
You okay?
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
You bet.
You don't act like it?
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
I'll be right back.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
I'm going into the movie business.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Hello, Martin.
Lufkin. His... agent.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Thanks.
Leave my sister alone.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
What is it now?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Are you going to yell at me?
About what?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
And what can you tell us about this...
Who is this, Enid?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
Hmm.
So what do you think?
Well, yes...
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
Huh?
I didn't check my messages...
Help me what?
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --

Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Yeah
What do you think?
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of 'frozen yogurt'?
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
So Josh...
That guy rules!
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
No.
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Aren't there a million places like this?
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
So, where's 'Weird Al'?
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
I figured something like that...
Jesus, look at this guy.
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Forget it.
You need counseling.
Hi Josh.
Hi.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Yeah, well... hi...
Hi... what's up?
Can I come in?
Are you the one who left that note?
I guess.
Do you want something to drink?
What do you mean 'why'?
Yeah, right... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Nothing.
When did I say I hated you?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
That's just the way I am!
Yeah, well --
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Why do you have that stupid poster?
How long have you been up?
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Why not?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
Hey Josh.
Are you ready to go?
God, what a bunch of retards...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Why?
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an 'F' that means you have to take the class over again.
You loser.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Shut up!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
What? Why?
Forget it...
Since when is she an 'actress'?
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
How perfect.
He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Good.
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
Hi.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Just look at them!
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Did you sign up yet?
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
We should follow them!
Much later.
In fact, never.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
That lets us off the hook.
Or maybe not.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Hey, look at this...
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Can we call you Weird Al?
I might actually get the pasta special.
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like The Salad Explosion?
I know... and instead of dessert it says Mindbenders.
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  Windsurfing Doctor
Okay, well here's yours...  Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod
Gross.
Jesus! Listen to this one: Do you remember me? Airport shuttle
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Oh, we totally have to.
Does Oomie really like this show?
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
So what should we do?
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Look at how cute I am!
What a little hosebag.
There's my dad with Joanie.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
What are you talking about -- who?
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Fuck you!
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Oh yeah.
You call.
Why do I always have to do it?
You're better at it.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for dwarf!
What does it stand for?
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
Look, maybe that's him!
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I want to make love to him.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
SHUT UP!
She says she wants to MMPH!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
I can't believe it!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
What's he doing now?
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
Are you sure?
We should follow him home.
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
This is way too creepy.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
Bingo!
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Come on, it's too late now...
Ew, look at this...
Gross!
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
That was truly pathetic.
I know... I still can't get over that his name was Seymour.
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
What about the striking redhead in the yellow dress?
Oh yeah...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't cool... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Forget it, I can't explain it...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
Somewhere downtown.
Funky?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Just promise you'll do it.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
What? How long have you been standing there?
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
Fuck you, bitch!
We still have to go in there sometime.
It's always closed...
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
Where are we going?
Let's go hassle Josh.
Hassle?
There he is...
As always.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
JOSH!
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
It'll only take a second.
What was that all about?
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
I didn't get it either.
How about this one?
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
How about this?
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I know a party we could go to...
What? Where?!
It's a surprise.
I don't believe you.
I totally, totally hate you.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Wait...
Give me all your money, bitch!
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Where?
No way... when?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
You cunt!
That guy is totally amazing.
He does that every single day.
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
That rules!
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
But those are our people...
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Which one?
You're just jealous.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Now are you going to get a regular job?
Don't worry.
Yeah, thanks.
Do you want to do something tonight?
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Yeah, I guess... call me...
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
Go ahead...
No, really...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
Look, we have to get these...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
What thing?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
Hello?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
So should I come over?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
I don't believe you.
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
Nothing.
When was this?
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
Great...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Well, what am I supposed to say? I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere?!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
Hello?
I need to talk to you.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
It's fine.
There.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
What time?
I dunno...
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
Hi.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Do you want anything?
Wow... finally.
It just came yesterday...
What about me? Am I not even here?
We're not.
Just because.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Nothing.
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
What are you doing here, Melorra?
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Shhh!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
A what?
How much is this?
That's okay...
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Who does?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
It's kind of falling apart.
Where did you get those pants?
Tell me what?
That's not even --
That tape sucked, by the way!
Go die, asshole!
Hi... what's your name?
...are you waiting for a bus?
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
You're late, asshole.
Did you bring that tape?
I did too!
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Later, Dude.
That's five hundred dollars.
Five hundred.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Do you have any old Indian records?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect foreign.
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Sure, I guess.
Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
Wow!
How much is it?
Okay.
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, Devil Got My Woman -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Wow!
Watch my stuff.
Oops! I dropped it!
NO!!!
Hey, I was only kidding!
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Really? Can I see it?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
Oh, right...
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Good luck...
I'm totally serious!
Yeah, well...
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
What about her? Would you go out with her?
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
Jesus!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
I'm just not one of those guys who has a type...
Every guy has a type!
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Let's just say music - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
So is that your boyfriend?
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Well are --
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Yeah, sure... very funny....
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
I don't think so...
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
OH MY GOD!
Look at this -- Lollipop Lolitas - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
So, why did you bring this along?
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Jesus, Seymour.
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Just wait here.
Jesus...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Hooray for me.
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
Yet.
Wow, this is so cool...
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
What, are you a klansman or something?
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS!
Yeah, well Cook's is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named The Coon Chicken Inn -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
For nineteen years...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Yeah, but still...
I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Hey, can I borrow this?
What? Why?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Don't you trust me, Seymour?
You can open your eyes now.
Are you okay?
What is that?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
What, like a girdle?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Really?
Never...
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Oh yeah?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Why?
I won't even dignify that with a response.
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Who knows?
Aren't you going to get that?
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
Wow!  What was that all about?
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
How can you be so sure?
Uh... hello?
Hi, it's me...
So, what happened?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
What? You're kidding me...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
Boo!
YAAA!
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
Really?
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
Sounds good...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
...I better not...
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
Well when can we do something?
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
And you like them?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
What does she mean by that - somebody like me?
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
...What do you mean?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
What's up?
Can you at least let me in?
Uh... sure... come in.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What's the matter?
Do you have anything to drink?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
Where did you get this?
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my old time thingamajigs.
Jesus, how can you stand her?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
That's great! Half-empty - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I'm just being realistic.
I hate sports.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What about Joe?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
What do you want?
I-I-I...
What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
I will if you want to.
No... forget it...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Yeah, well... me neither...
But, I...
Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Please Josh?
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I agree.
I wish I could see him.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Yeah.
Call me sometime.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
What do we have here, Margaret?
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
No... they said she was here...
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
Why? What did she tell you?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
That slut!
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Did she say that?
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
Thank you, doctor.
Yes?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
What do you want with my baby?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
Everybody has a choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
I'd rather not.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
What are you working on, Egon?
Do you ever see him?
How is he these days?
Does he ever mention me?
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Thank you.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
You're also a human being, Frank.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
No, you didn't, Frank.
That's exactly what you said last week.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
He didn't ditch me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Well, when you started introducing me as the old ball and chain
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
What do you think?
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
Oscar!  You poor kid!
I'll supervise.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
We definitely had a moment or two.
That's where the buggy stopped.
Okay, let's take a look.
Fine, thirty.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Good luck.
Thanks.
So this is what you do, huh?
Oh, hello, Peter.
You're really good, you know.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
Good-bye, Peter.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Or we could do that.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
Are you all squeaky clean now?
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Does she know anything about babies?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
I'm not even good for me.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Let me jingle you right now.
Maybe I should call Janine.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
That's not true.  It was 1620.
Same difference.
That's a terrible thing to say.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Hi, Egon.
Is this the spot?
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Sorry!
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
What is it, honey?
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
Who are you going to call?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
What are you doing up here?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
Well, good night, Louis.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Okay.
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
Tonight?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
You're right.  We should stay.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I know.
Then why have you come?
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
This is the one that looked at Dana.
I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
Command me, lord.
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow --
I await the word of Vigo.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Who are they?
Maybe they just want to appeal.
These boys aren't playing around.
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Do I?
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Can I have some of your water?
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
Did I forget something?
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Egon!
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I don't even want to know where that is.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
What now, Brainiac?
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
You need the exercise.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
So far so good.
Pretty impressive, huh?
From where -- Neptune?
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
Nothing.  Not a trace.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
And we're the ...
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Do it!  Just do it!
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Oh, Ray --
Who?  Who?  Who?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
What's that?
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm Ray --
I'm Peter --
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
And now you're going to eat it?
This is what you do with your spare time?
'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
What kind of tests?
You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
I'll get one more reading.
What happened?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
I hate Jello.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
My Fault!
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
What's your story, Pete?
Ready?
I'm ready.
Then let's do it.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
Does it have any favorites?
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal Stabilize -- All Clear.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Are you telling me how to drive?
Well don't think!
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
She's moving!
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
Tell him about the toaster.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
And pure --
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Wonder what?
If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Hello.
Hello.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Yes.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Do you always drive like this?
Yes.
Do you want some dinner?
No.
Why not?
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No -- why should I?
I don't know.
Could you do it?
No.
I think I'd better go home now please.
But, Elaine --
Where is the car?
I just want to tell you something.
I want to go home.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
What?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No, I couldn't.
But could you try?
No.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Yes, I do.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
All right.
Where we going?
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Benjamin --
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Of course not.
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
Do you?
Yes.
You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Was she married or something?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Did they ever find out?
No.
Yes.
I'm glad.
All right.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Yes.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
I do.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Why aren't you ready?
What is it?
That woman --
What?
That woman. The older woman.
You mean the one who --
Oh my God --
It's about time.
A deal's a deal.
No -- don't cry --
GET OUT!
Don't cry.
Get out of here.
I'm meeting someone.
Ah. Where?
Where are you meeting this person?
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
Is that him over there?
No.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Oh.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Yes.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
But you're not enrolled.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
-- really incredible --
Here he comes.
What?
Come in.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I think it is.
I said I think it is.
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
What?
Did you say rape her?
how you  how anyone  could do a thing like that.
What did she say?
Let me go.
You've got to tell me what she said.
Why?
Because it isn't true.
I don't feel well.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Then what?
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
If you want.
What are you looking for?
My belt.
Don't you have it on?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
The marble?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
Oh.
What are you going to do now?
I don't know.
Are you going home?
No.
Well -- where are you going?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
I don't understand.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
But Elaine --
Benjamin?
What?
Will you kiss me!
I might.
Is that so? You might marry me?
When?
I don't know.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
You mean you're confused?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
I don't see how we can.
I have to go back now.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Yes.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
I just don't think it would work.
Why wouldn't it?
Why wouldn't it?
I just don't think it would...
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Carl who?
Carl who?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Yes.
Why do you have to see him?
Well -- I said I might marry him.
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
No, Benjamin.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Oh no. He said that.
Shhhh.
Where did he do it?
Are we getting married tomorrow?
No.
The day after tomorrow?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Benjamin?
What?
Hello -- who is this?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Mr. McQuire.
Yes, sir.
You a student?
What's that?
What are you then?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
Ahhh.
You're not one of those agitators?
What?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Who screamed?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
No, sir.
Mr. McCleery?
You heard me. Out of here.
What for?
Because I don't like you.
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
I want you out of here.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I am going to call the police now.
Get out!
Yes.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Mrs. Robinson?
Well I'll hand it to you.
I'm putting it on the top step.
I'm putting it here by the door.
I'd rather not.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
What?
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
Ahh -- thank you.
Yes sir?
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Will you sign the register, please?
Is anything wrong, sir?
What? No. Nothing.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Oh no.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Of course.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Whatever you say, sir.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
It's down the hall.
Is there an ashtray in here?
No.
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Is it a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
In general.
That's right.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
What?
Will you take me home?
What?
You don't?
No.
Right.
Will you come in, please?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
What for?
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
But it's light in there now.
Please.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
All right then.
What do you drink?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
Drink?
Yes.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
What?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
No.
My husband will be back quite late.
Oh my God.
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What's wrong?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Like what?
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
Aren't you?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's all right.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Yes.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Very much.
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Will you unzip my dress?
I think I'll go to bed.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
I know that. But I'm --
Come on.
Right.
What are you so scared of?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Then why do you keep running away?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Yes, I have --
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
But they would! Don't you see?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Would you like me to seduce you?
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Where is it?
On that chair in the hall.
Don't be nervous.
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
Jesus Christ!
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Let me out!
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Yes, I do.
I've got to go.
Benjamin?
Yes.
Thank you for taking me home.
Hello, Benjamin.
May I sit down?
Of course.
How are you?
May I have a drink?
A drink? Of course.
Waiter!
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
Did you get us a room?
What?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.
Do you want to?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Do you want me to get it?
Do you want to get it now?
Now?
Yes.
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
I got a single room.
That's fine.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Yes?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
The number.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Well.
Benjamin.
Yes?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Why don't you watch?
Will you bring me a hanger?
A hanger.
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Either one will be fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Is this -- what?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
You can admit that, can't you?
Are you kidding?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
That you're afraid --
Wait a minute.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
INADEQUATE!
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Are you tired of it?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Well?
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
How about art.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Oh.
Don't you?
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Go ahead then.
Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Neither.
No.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
I don't.
Can I take off my clothes now?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Yes I do.
Do what?
Do you want to hear it or not?
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What one.
What novel did you read.
I don't remember.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
There!
What?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Him?
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
There isn't any.
There's no risk?
How do you get out of the house?
I walk out.
You walk right out the door.
What do you say to him?
He's asleep.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We're talking.
What?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Right.
Thank you.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
We don't.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
No we don't.
About five years.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
No.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
How many times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Is it?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I don't.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Is it?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
No.
What?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Why did you do that?
See if you can guess.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Don't tell Elaine.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Are you shocked?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
What?
Not particularly.
And you were a student also.
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Why are you asking me all this?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.
Art?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Well how did it happen?
How do you think.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
Oh no. In the car you did it?
I don't think we were the first.
What kind of car was it?
What?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
That's enough.
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
Don't talk about Elaine.
No.
Why not?
Because I don't want you to.
I wish you'd tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Do you understand that?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
No.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Yes.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Are you?
You're goddamn right I am.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
What?
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Did I say that?
Of course you did.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
You wouldn't.
Of course I wouldn't.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
If that's how you feel --
But it's not.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
But if it's sickening for you --
You don't have to say that.
May I stay then?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Then give me your word you won't.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Drive down the block.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Mrs. Robinson --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I don't believe you.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Go home now.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Where is Elaine?
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
What the hell have you done?
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
I don't think so.
I say I've got it.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
No -- actually I'm not --
Yes, but I'm afraid --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Sure.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
I drive around.
What else?
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Meet someone?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
Not if you don't want to.
I do.
But I don't want you to make up something.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
Goodnight, Benjamin.
You believe me, don't you?
No.
You don't?
Goodnight.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
I do.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
No -- they don't.
About an hour ago.
When did you two talk this over?
We haven't.
I'm just --
worried?
About what?
What about it?
I don't know. I want it to be --
To be what?
Different.
Why?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Have you thought about graduate school?
No.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
You got me.
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
That has nothing to do with it --
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
Say that again.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Oh no.
What?
I've got to go.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Thank you very much, sir.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Thank you.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Sir?
You'll never be young again.
I know.
What?
How long have we known each other now?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Thank you.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
I'd like to hear it.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Oh no.
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
I will.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Mr. Robinson?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
No, it's not --
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Now look -- please --
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
I am not threatening you.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
No, I don't.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
But why?
Why?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
That's quite a statement.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
You miss the point.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
HUH?
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
Yes?
Yes?
Benjamin -- where are you?
Yes, I can.
This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
Is anything wrong?
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
They are?  Come on.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
What's happening?
I don't believe it.
That what he says. Right?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Hey.
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Does this conversation have a purpose?
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Miss me, baby?
I dunno, boy.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Home, sweet home.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
We'll see.
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
How all the magazines show tits today.
Um.
I suppose.
Must have changed that law.
Home.
You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
How everybody says fuck and shit all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say fuck or shit in public, by accident.  Now everybody says fuck and shit
At least!
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
Tell them yourself!
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I didn't tell you everything.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
This room is full of ghosts.
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
The hell with the diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Can I have the Cadillac?
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
What'll you do for transportation?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
Go home!
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
So long, Colonel.
You know what gets me?
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Months?
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
I'm lonesome already.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Go home!
You ever own a motorcycle?
Haven't got one.
And how were things?
Let's talk about something else.
Otherwise, how are things?
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
Could have happened to anybody.
First Nagasaki--now this.
I dunno, boy.
The educational process.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
What's funny about that?
You know me, boy.
Excuse me.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
How do you know that?
When?
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Really?
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, Oh
Sorry.
Go to the funeral?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I didn't know we had any women left.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
You keep on saying deep and deeply. I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
I dunno.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
Hi, Penelope.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
What's this?
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
In what way, pray tell?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
You never played a violin.
You did?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again. That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, Jesus--who could blame her?
Maybe it's time you got out.
Me?
You.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much. You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
Hello.
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Our pleasure.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Blue soup.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
What you say is, Pass the fucking catsup.
Pass the fucking catsup.
You actually sold insurance!
What an awful sound!
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
I've considered that.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
Fifty years?
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
What?
We got to get another pilot.
For what?
For Africa.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
You invited me.
To make an ass of yourself.
What went wrong?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Gee whiz--
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
You're hollow, like a woman.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
You're my buddy.
Out!  Out!
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Thank God!
Anybody home?
As a matter of fact--
Sir?
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you--
Are you--do you--
Ask it!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Is anybody besides you here now?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Where's Mom?
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
I'll see.
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Man and boy.
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--Herb Shuttle, you said?
He worships Father.
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
She met him at college.
College!
They were in the same creative writing class.
College?
She has a master's degree in English literature.
He insults him all the time.
Excellent!
What's good about that?
It makes life spicy.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
Dad?  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Dad was never in England?
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him La Picadura--the sting.
The sting.
The sting.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Tell me that.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
Uck.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
I don't know.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
Where did you get the poison?
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, Major
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
Mhravitch.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Sir?
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
They're not engaged.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Sir?
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Can't it keep till morning?
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Penelope!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Will you go to bed?
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Damn.
Mom?
Play?
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
A hundred dollars!
The smallest thing I've got.
Make it fast.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Leave a tip.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
No.
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
Dad?
Who was it?
It's Mom.
What's this?
What's this?
Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
No.
Open the bolt!
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Dad--
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
It's your house, Dad.
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
I'm talking to you gently now.
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
Can I help you, sir?
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Sir?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
What time do you get off work, my child?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
I'm engaged.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
This is crazy.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
What do you do for a living?
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Some kind of animal?
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Not at all.
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
What's the matter?
Give us time.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Disease?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Bluh.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
What's that all about?
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Nothing would please me more.
Thank God!
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Harold!
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Please--
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Say hello to your mother.
Do say hello to your mother.
Now that's what I call fun.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
I did?
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have a brain.
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
Ram it up your ass!
Breakfast?
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
Which one?
Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
What a honeymoon.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
You're wrong.
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
You're a woman, aren't you?
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
What then?
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
That's what you're supposed to say.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
It couldn't!
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Fish can't feel.
Such as?...
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
Go on.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
You learned this in some college course?
The doctor.
And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
Yes.
And no one's there now?
I don't think so.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
What are you going to do?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
No you're not!
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
I came for my clothes.
Sneaking in the back door.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
I came for Paul as well.
If he wants to go.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
A dozen?
It's a big and busy funeral home.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Unless she has nerve.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
He cried.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
Two hundred years old.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Things.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Almost a Christmas scene.
Just one favor.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Rifle?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Blue soup?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang Oh Promise Me. Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to Oh Promise Me?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
Like what?
He's a child!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I plan to live one hundred years!
No you don't.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Honor, I suppose.
What a handsome word.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
No.
No.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
I'm going to call the police.
Don't!
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
Stop!
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
I mean it!
Where's the bullet?
Who's that?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
He always look so
How do I load?
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Out!
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Do it, Norbert.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
But here you are inside, aren't you?
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
Hello, Mother.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
She's crying because she's so happy.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancÃš is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: the Woodly galloping crud.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means cougar fang. Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Hundreds.
We have, have we?
Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
You were wrong, you quack!
What for?
It died for your sins.
This is man to man.
He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
Now who's being cruel?
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Comical?
And terror, if you don't mind.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
I love you!  Have a cigar!
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I'm an honorable clown?
You hope.
Cut me open.  Find out.
With spittle?
Poison.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
I see.
Don Quixote.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
The new hero is you.
You're too modest.
Was I ever of use?
Here.  Finish the job.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
I'm going to shoot you now.
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
If you want to be found that way.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
I've enjoyed being man.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Can't do it.
It's trash now, like mine.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
I dunno, boy.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
Alice got married again.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
So that's it! Kestenbaum
Dead!
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
For what?
For saying shit. Or is that okay now?
Who's dead?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
What happened?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, Guess who? She conked right out.
How horrible.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
I dunno.
So long, you guys.
What will you do, Colonel?
I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.
I don't care what she wears.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Kid--kid--
What's this?
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
Thank God!
That goes double for me.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
I'll kill myself.
Don't touch me.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
No.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
I know.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
He's alive!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
Thank you, kind sir.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
A what kind of doctor?
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Still lives with his mother.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
How did she lose her feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I don't really know.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
I hate that thing.
It's beautiful.
Where will you be?
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Who have you been talking to?
What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
Yes, he is.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Is Norbert still here?
Father's friend.
What's his name?
Don't know.
For Heaven's sakes!
Mom?
What?
I don't get it.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
That's why I'm crying.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
What does he say to do?
He can hardly talk.
Really?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Yeah.
Then get him.
Okay.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
We don't have a maid any more.
Everything stays as it is!
My father!
Don't worry about it.
It's fine!
Keeps fairies away!
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
He isn't any friend of Father.
He is my father.
Please--
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
Doing what?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
He'd assume we had.
That's something I suppose.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
Yes?
Something happens to my confidence.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
I'm touched.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
I see.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Good night.
Coming.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
What then?
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
Did you see him?
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
Is he coming home?
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
The park!
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
You figure!
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
A what?
How nice.
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, Happy Birthday
Did you talk to Paul?
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
What was it?
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
Possibly.
How long has this been going on?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
Marry me instead.
You're saying no.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
You were wonderful.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
It's true.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
You and Harold are friends?
He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
We made the date three months ago.
She quit this afternoon.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
War is not healthy for children and other living things. How lovely.
What?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
That's the XKE.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
It's suicide!
Meaning?
Why would you do that?
I'm amazed.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
We've got to rescue him.
It's a jungle out there.
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
You know each other?
How neat.  How keen.
Get out of here.
You fool, you fool.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Do it!
Is that a fact?
Or get eaten alive.
Phooey.
Penelope!  We're late!
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Just a little.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
We can take off the Wanda June with a butter knife.
What's this?
An attempted slit.
Oh, I don't have one.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
No, no. I just took it.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Hello.
Haven't we met before?
We planted it.
No.
Officer, I can explain.
Check.
Oh no! Not in my name.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Because if you are...
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Sorry I'm late.
What do you see?
Here's your shovel.
Eh, no. Thank you.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, no.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
I don't know.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Harold Chasen.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
What?
Eh, no.
No.  I thought not.
Yes.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Yes.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
But this is my car.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Not any car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't own anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't ownership a little absurd?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to things. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Oh, look! The birds.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Well then.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
Oh, at the dentist's?
All right.
My door is always open.
Harold?
Maude???!
Eh, fine.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
She seemed yare to me.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Me! No. Of course not.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
No.
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the Rape of Rome and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant. Do you like it?
Yes. Very much.
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my Odorifics.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... Snow!
It goes on and on.
That's really great.
What do you think?
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You look as if you could.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
You don't look eighty.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
That's a nice teapot.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
What do you mean?
I don't know. Just one of those.
Why do you say that?
Because they are all the same.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were alive, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Well...
What?
Over there by the courthouse.
What is it?
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
But we can't just dig it up!
Exactly.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
Oh, my. We're too late.
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
We'll come back in the morning.
What is that he's working on?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
It is kind of rough.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Look, the ice is melting.
Yes.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Well, I really don't drink...
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
Thank you.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Thank you.
What's that?
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
No.
Well, I don't...
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
Superb.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
He's stopped.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. The earth is my body. My head is in the stars.  Who said that?
I don't know.
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I think I see it.
Yes. It's almost there.
Yes.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
I like Glaucus.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Well, I really don't smoke.
It's all right.  It's organic.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, Don't simply be good. Make good things happen.
Did Confucius say that?
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
You are the wisest person I know.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. The wisest
What was that?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Of course.
Okay.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an L. Give me an I.  Give me a V. Give me an E. LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
It's so blue.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Maude, do you pray?
Pray? No.  I communicate.
With God?
With Life.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
Well, why don't you?
No. I'd feel stupid.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Yodeling?
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can.
Where's that?
From the guys who got the matches, of course.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
Oh.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
Maude, I must speak to you.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
But they have.
Well, don't go.
But they'll put me in jail.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Don't you advance on me.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
That wasn't very scary.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
How about some candy floss?
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Well, they're my species.
Look at the stars.
Do you think there is any life up there?
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
We are alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
You should have been a poet.
end Where I began.
Maude.
Yes.
Here.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
I took them out.
Why?
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.
It looks like you. Thanks.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
Supper for two.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold.
For you.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
But why now?
I thought eighty was a good round number.
I feel giddy.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
It's true. I can't live without you.
And this too shall pass away.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Mother.
Mother.
I'm getting married.
To a girl. Here.
What?
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
How do you do?
Would you like a cigarette?
Is Sunshine your real name?
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
No. My uncle.
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
No. Like this.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
And why is that?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Just give me a rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Fifteen.
A rough estimate.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I wouldn't say benefit.
No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Does that worry you?
Yes. It does.
Why?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
And a lot of time.
No.
What about the draft?
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
I don't know.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
What else do you like?
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for fun? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
I go to funerals.
Harold?
Huh?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
None at all?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
No.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Yes.
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Yes.
Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
No.  I'd have liked to.
Why?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
What would you say?
What kind of stuff?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Thank you, Uncle.
Call me sir
Yes, sir.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
War is not all black.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! Throw the grenades
Jeez! That's a great story,
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
That's right.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Another man's life in your sights.
Yes.
ZAT!
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Oh sure.
Yes.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Eh?
How about to slit his throat?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
What's the chance of getting one of these?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Parasite!
Harold!
Harold, calm down! This is...
She took my head.
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Do I know you?
Alison's.
Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
You gotta be kidding me.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What are you doing?
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
What's next?
Play it.
Say it.
Little Latin Lupe Lu.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
We'll do it next Monday.
Well what's the point in that?
Nice, Barry.
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  Is it better to burn out than to fade away?
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Not the point.
Oh, so what's the point then?
She's not a...
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, Any school you want
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
Yeah.
But now I kind of like it.
I wanna date a musician...
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
What did you tell her about the shop for?
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
We can take your car.
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
What?
What do you mean, what?
What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... Janie Jones
Ehh.
Thunder Road, Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. Smells Like Teen Spirit
Shut up. Let's Get It On
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! Let's Get It On? Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does yet mean, anyway?  I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet. What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
...But the word yet... Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Why would they care?
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Suck my ass.
Terrific.
Hey.
What the fuck is that?
What band?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
Isn't it?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
How many tickets can I put you down for?
None.  Christ!
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
Laura.  Her dad died.
Ooh.  Drag.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Whatever.  Okay. Tell Laura I Love Her. That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Fuck off, Barry.
I'd want One Step Beyond by Madness. And You Can't Always Get What You Want.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Haven't seen it.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
Not really.
The little skate-fuckers.
Yes way.  It's really...
What?
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that what shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?
Like fuck you are.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
We're getting that anyway.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
No.  We need the gig.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Sonic Death Monkey.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
No, you can't.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
NO--!
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
What?
Nothing.
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Bullshit.
She shouldn't done it on The Number Four With a Smile.
Isn't her album called Number Four With A Smile?
That's what I said.
No, no, no, you said The Number Four With a Smile
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a The.  But I could be wrong.
You can be and are wrong.
He's got one!
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
You'd love it!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Why?
Who are you going to see?
Nobody.
Anna.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Anna Moss.
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
He's not worth it!
Okay, okay -- Leader of the Pack. The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? Dead Man's Curve
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
it was Dean; you fucking idiot.
Somebody's Gonna Die by Blitz. Bella Lugosi's Dead
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Oh, hi.
Where's Rob?
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
What are you talking about?
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
May I help you?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Uh.  That's me.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Right.  Why?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
So.  Is now a good time?
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.
Is there a difference?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. Sin City by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
What do you mean, four more?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... Sin City. New Rose
Is that it?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Nice friend.
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Music for Old People. What does that mean?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
'Morning, Dick.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Good weekend?
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Great.
I'll tape it for you.
No, that's okay.  Really.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Okay.
What's this?
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Are you all right?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Fine.
I understand, Dick.
Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
I always hated this song.
Yeah.
Let's not.
I want a tape.
Rob.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Rob --!
-- FUCK OFF!
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Do it.  Do it.
Well we rang $900 today.
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Can I do anything?
Abraham, Martin, and John. That's a nice one.
What is this.
It's Vince and Justin.
Who's that?
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Yeah.
I dunno.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
I dunno.
Well stay for tonight, then.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
I should be so lucky.
Shit!
Hi.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Are you coming home?
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
My house?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
-- Alright, alright but --
And who says I like Marvin Gaye; anyway?
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! Got to Give It Up! That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
But don't you remember?
I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection.
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
You really believe that?
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
Not really.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
No.
What?
What, what?
Did you say something?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I don't know.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
I suppose so.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Yeah.  Great.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Fine.  One.
It sounds stupid.
Nevermind.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Is what better?  Better than what?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Of course it is.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
Never?
I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Hi.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.
Great... That's great.
So, how are you?
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I guess.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
Nothing.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Will you call me?
I don't have your number.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
You do, huh.
Hello.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing Doctor Who-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
I'm not -- hold on...
Are you still in love with me?
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
You don't ever think about other people?
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Is that the last of it?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
It was kind of funny.
I'm sure.
You still together?  Going all right?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
I hate him too.  So I just call him Mavis. Or Sissyboy. Or Mavis the Sissyboy.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
You know I'm a good person.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
You think this'll work?
No fear.
Don't forget your CDs.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
Well, think about it.
Hello.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
I can't talk right now.
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
Are you alright?
Pigsty.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Who the fuck's Pig?
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
I'm sorry.
No, no.  When are you going home?
In a minute.  When I get it together.
Me?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Do you want me to be there?
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Look, are you coming or not?
Yes, of course.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
Uh... No.
You're soaking.
Mmnn.
You're also an idiot.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
What do you mean?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
I don't want to go back.
What do you want to do?
C'mon.
When are you going back?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Hi.
You know, with Ray...
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
Laura...
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Mission accomplished.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Let's go home.  Okay?
Okay.
C'mon.  I want to know.
What it was like.
What's the difference?
You know the difference.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
To make you feel better.
Oh, great...
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
Okay.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
How?  How were we the same people?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
No, but...
But what?
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
You're tougher.
More confident, maybe.
Harder.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
I'm alright.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
You're being stupid.
How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
No use.
Hi.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
Ha.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, would be a highly anticipated event
WHAT?
Just local, of course.
And the triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon? Triumphant? Return?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Barry said its done.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
We took care of that.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
I know.  I don't get it.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
I'm going to talk to you.
Right.
What are you going to talk to me about?
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I mean it.
I know.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Would you marry me if I was?
No.  Probably not.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
Are you persuadable?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Fair enough.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
About what?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Well, you've asked.
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Rob here.
Hey.  It's Liz.
You called this morning?
How're you holding up?
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
It's true!
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were kind of looking around for somebody else!
Well she --
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
It's a crematorium.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Is Ray going?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Enough, Liz.
Enough of what?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
If by we you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
So you live in Chicago now?
Don't you like that?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Hi, Marie.
Everything go alright?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song Patsy Cline Times Two I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Thank you.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
You share a place with T-Bone?
I understand completely.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
The Conformist.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Yes.  You?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I'm sure it isn't.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Yeah.
Good.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Which way are you going?
That way.  You?
That way.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
I'll call you.
Right.
Yeah?
Hi, Mom.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
So so.  Up and down.
She left.  She's gone.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
Hello?  Anybody there?
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
But you must have --
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Thirteen hundred.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
I think you have more.
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the mothers
Fuck off.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Whatever.
Nice.
What'd he say?
Who cares?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Hello, Bensinger.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
Exactly!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
I'll keep you in mind.
Bon jour!
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
Oh, it isn't like that.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
Too hot?
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
He certainly -- hic -- does!
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
But --
I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
All right, dear.
The five hundred? Sure.
But --
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
The check, Bruce!
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
Yes, wasn't it?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
I'm sure you haven't any.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Did you finish the interview?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
Hello, Bruce...
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
We'll explain the whole thing to them.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Where'd she go?
Out some place.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Thank you.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
Fine.
Mr. Burns --
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
I'm Bruce Baldwin!
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Then who are you?
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Oh.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Where are we going?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
No -- she didn't.
Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy, my treat!
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
Mother? But your mother --
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
How's business, Bruce?
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
I don't blame them.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
I see what you mean.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
How?
How long would the interview take?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
I'm beginning to realize that.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Well, she'll know some day.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Thanks a lot.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
So long.
Hildy!
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
That's the kind of stuff they want!
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Get out!
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
Do you want to get us scooped?
What's this?
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Your luck's not with you now!
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
The power of the press, huh!
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Out of the mouths of babes.
He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
What do you want?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Hello, Hildy!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  -- any time -- any place -- anywhere!
I notice you still remember it.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
What home?
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
You can break it, can't you?
Sure you can. Come on.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
What do you mean by that?
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You've had a better offer, eh?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Listen, Walter --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
You -- you --
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
What's the matter?
Sweeney.
Dead?
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
No!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Keep away --
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
That's what I'm afraid of. Any time -- any place -- anywhere!
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Get away, Svengali.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Please! Will you just --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I'm not working for any other paper!
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
Look at this!
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Bermuda.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
What's his line?
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Thanks...
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Say, could I meet him?
You're not afraid, are you?
Afraid? I should say not!
Better.
Then what does he want with you?
Now you got me.
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Allow me.
Thanks.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
Thank you.
What now?
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
You said it.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
Now you're talking!
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
What tricks would I pull?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Exclusive? That's great.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind that. What's the story?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Hold on a minute.
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
I know. Where is he, I said.
Where do you think you're going?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
I know, but --
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
I'd like to think.
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
Huh!
All the words you've got.
Where's some paper?
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Okay, Walter.
Hildy!
Where's Butch?
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
What tickets?
Railroad tickets.
Is he coming back here?
Double-crossing swine!
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
I'm finished.
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
Louie!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Was she? Did you notice?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
Look at me, Hildy --
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Hello -- hello...
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Is this the Community Hospital?
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Come here. See if we can move it.
Will you come here?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Yes.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Don't open that!
No, you don't! Walter!
What is it? Here!
No!
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Who did you talk to?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Don't tell me you were worried!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Well -- what is it?
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
Thanks.
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Where'd you wire him?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Walter!
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
What's the matter with my brains?
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
What!
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Walter, you can't do that!
It'll be Heaven!
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
You -- you!!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
You grey-haired old Judas!
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
You got plenty of money?
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I'm busy, Duffy.
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
They can't do that to me!
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
Yes, sir.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Well, that about covers everything.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Three bullets! Any good?
Beats king up.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Open up there, will you!
All right -- all right!
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
She looks as though she's going to come to.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Boy, did you see her go?
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
So have we!
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Who engineered this getaway?
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
I'll have it in a minute.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Goodbye, Yonson.
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Now, where is he?
How's everything, Gus?
I guess so.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Gus, this --
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Take your paws off me!
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
What do I know about Williams?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
With a bag of marshmallows.
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
That's murder!
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
Where is he?
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
Pete, you're through!
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
What is it?
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Cover up that transmitter!
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
We'll fix that, too.
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
A sight for sore eyes!
Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
Who is this man?
I never saw him before!
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Go on -- shoot me!
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
You'll take fifty and like it!
Editorials?
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
What did you do with her?
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me!
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Who is it?
Give me that!
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean dear. That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
Any news?
And up a dime.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
I thought so, too.
No -- what?
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back.
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
Look out, you --
Have you got my dough?
Come on with that money!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
You know it is!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Kings and sixes.
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
Hiding him where?
Mother!
Mother!
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
Production for use only. Well, maybe that's the answer.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Very simple, Earl.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
Don't forget about production for use.
Put down that gun, Earl.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your Production for Use.
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Don't talk too loud.
Sure I do, Earl.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
How'd you get here, Earl?
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
What good'll it do?
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Quiet, Mollie!
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Ssh!
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
Are you all right, now?
What do you want?
What's from the Governor?
Get the Governor on the phone!
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
How much do you make a week?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Who do you think!
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
The City Sealer's office!
Yes, yes!
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
For heaven's sake, why not?
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
Get out of here!
A very fine-looking women.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Come on, fellas.
There she is!
We want to see you.
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
Oh, right.  Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
I know a lot more than that
You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
Seven-thirty?
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
It's embarrassing, okay?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Hello, my little boy.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Say my name.
Woof.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
French?
Oui.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oui, doctor, oui.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Oui.
You decide. Today is your day.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Not at all.
Of course not.
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Is everything fine?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
When you were a little French girl?
Oui.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Yes. Happy happy.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
I am sleepy.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Shh.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Hmmmph.
Gabby, what is it?
Fine.
Very well.
My little French.
Stop. Get away.
What is it?
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Unnhh.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Yeah? What?
Hi. It's Nathan.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
I just want to talk.
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Like what?
What for?
Well, I think...
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
What?
Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Well?
Please. I look a mess.
No. You look so beautiful.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
I've moved on.
No!
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
That's not how he tells it.
Hunh.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
You were wonderful!
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said  au revoir.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Lila?
That's Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
I don't know. Something's missing.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
I don't know.
I want our boy back.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
We still have you and I.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Please let me go with you.
Okay.
It's okay, Puff.
Shan't happen again.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Very well.
Very well.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
You what?
I want to be the way I was before.
Nice night.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
He's dead.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
That's what I'm counting on.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Okay. If you think it will help.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Always. Ow.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Shut up and tell me.
What do you mean?
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Won't he be able to tell?
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
One night stand?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Three foot one.
And I think I'm going to.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking do not disturb sign on the fucking doorknob?
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Rose, please go away.
How'd you know where I was?
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
Oh, Rosie.
Ready!
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
Shut up, you.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
I'll be in touch.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
As do I.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, Ewww. A slug.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
You are a therapist, right?
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
How's it going?
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
What's the larger experiment?
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
I'm not sure.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
We are animals after all.
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
No biggie.
Boy, this is good!
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
You do?
Yes, and...
You really enjoy my company?
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
You do?
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Nathan!
What are you doing in there?
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm sorry about my parents.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Do you?
Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Why certainly!
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Shaving cream?
I don't think so.  Why?
Yes, darling.
Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?
Fifteen.
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Yes, darling.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Flares?
Absolutely.
I love you so much.
Did you see that?
What?
I don't know. Something.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
Come on.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
I think he's feral.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
He looks perfectly fine.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
What?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
It's perfect!
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
All right.
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
Nothing. Be right out.
Who is it?
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Who is it?
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Who from work?
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Your entire body?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I have to think! I have to think!
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
I'm glad you're female.  Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
So, how's it going today?
Good. Making progress.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Hi.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Of course not.
It would just be helpful to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm just preoccupied.
Do you like my new look?
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Really?
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
How's work?
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
I guess.
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Really?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
How come?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Such as what womanly things?
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
I had sold my fucking soul.
I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.
That was wonderful!
I think he's ready.
Oh boy!
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
Thank you very much for that.
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
Should I come with?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
So he's doing okay?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his mad money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Shit.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yes.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Lila...
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Ugnh.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Oook. Oook.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Ooka.
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Oh boy!
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Okay. That's fair.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Lila?
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Yahoo!
Tomorrow, the acid test.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Extra dessert?
Even better.
Free to come and go as you please. There's some mad money in the night table drawer.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Got it.
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
Thanks to you, Nate.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
here, here.
Interesting.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Ugnh.
Puff, put the gun down.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
No.
No, why?
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Yes?
Mother?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
You're not a big talker, are you?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
You know who The Raincoats are?
What's this?
I'm getting trashed, man. Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Okay?
I said something.
No, not her. Me.
You're not gonna believe this...
What's going on?
Don't do that.
Al.
Yes?
Yes.
Yes.
What is your name?
I just got here.
Where are we?
What street?
Why don't we go home?
...I need to make a phone call.
Where are we now?
No.
Right.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Who are you?
Yeah...Who?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of the PEM114...
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Then how'd I get here?
I know...it sounds insane.
What for?
Are you crazy?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Of course you do!
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Yeah.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
You'll be alive.
Yeah.
What was that?
You weren't listening!
Why don't you?
No they won't.
I'll tell you what to say.
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
Anyone there?
Behind us?
What'd he look like?
Outrun them.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Then what are you stopping for?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Too late...They want you.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
Did you hear that?
It can't take that long.
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
You gotta help.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Sue them.
We have to get out of here.
Go out, take your first left.
With Authority!
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Who did?
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
What do you mean?
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
Don't know.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
I'm back.
Good. Get to a phone.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Nothing. You just do nothing.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Send a man there. A secret agent.
We get on a plane.
What about it?
Use my credit cards.
Why not?
Who cares?
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
We'll change your appearance.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
You'll be me.
The beach.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Do you notice anything.
Swim.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
You eat it.
The sand.
Eat it.
Why not?
Follow it.
You're out of shape.
What is it?
Try another language.
How should I know?
What can I do? You're on your own.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
.
Wait.
Where is she staying?
Touch her.
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
No...you idiot!
What happened?
Without your pants.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
It worked.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Well you did it today.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
What are you looking at?
But what's it look like?
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
Not that tie with that coat.
Doesn't.
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
Get close to them.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
The drinks...Stay on them.
Follow that busboy.
Just hold them close and stay still.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Just don't show fear.
It lends you an air of mystery.
Don't get too cute.
Joe, be careful!
They're all in it.
Voice stress analyzer.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
What is it, your charm?
What is it?
What if she says something important?
What am I supposed to do?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
What Happened?
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
Is that all?
Shit! You're in love.
You get time off to sleep.
You been had. We have.
Some agent you are.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Osaka.
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Follow her.
Come on, she's getting away.
Just stay here and rest.
Relax. Let me do this.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
One of your instincts?
Don't touch a thing.
...drink it.
Drink lots of water.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
A hard left. A hard left.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
Neither can they.
Never mind, just say it.
He was with Gruner!
No. You can't trust her.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
I don't trust her.
It's him.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
I've got an idea.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
haka xuki.
Cash.
Left...The one with the red dot.
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
While he makes the run.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Don't worry, I can.
Are you alright?
Aim just in front of his face.
...Shit! It's just money.
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
Sure, I do
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
Just let me sit down.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
And don't let her know, either.
This may hurt.
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Be quiet.
Gimme a minute.
Keep thinking.
About what?
Rene?
Now, you're too suspicious.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
You're a lucky man.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
It's all we've got.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
Not that truth!
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Doesn't matter.
The best part. She'll love it.
Do what? What'd you do?
Don't give her your name.
No!
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I'm against it.
Don't worry.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
What kind of a deal?
Then what?
I knew you were trouble.
Why'd you let him get to you?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
You know Chastity?
I believe we share an art instructor
Kat! Wake up!
What?
And I'm in control of it.
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Here. Got pictures.
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
Baby. You are so HOT!
Howard!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
You did good, Massey!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Course I can't do much wriggling if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a nurse
So she's uh, flourishing?
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
No!
I had no idea until after, but --
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
I just want to make sure that you both --
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. Th
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
And we are sure...
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
What part?
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Here's her picture...
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Triple!
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
What the hell is Botox?
Why in God's name would I want...?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
It was a gift from a client.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
I should be in therapy.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
What?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
He's the wrong man.
Thanks, buddy.
Asian? No.
You have the pre-nup?
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
My God.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Marylin! What have I done?
Ruth Rabino.
No.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
It's about time.
I said yes.
Well. He said to make the house mine.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
I'll be right back.
Ruth Rabinow; this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
How nice.
These are yours.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Isn't everything?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery.
Did you see the tape?
Not yet.
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
What does your lawyer think?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
But you don't agree?
How do you know?
Why would you be here?
I told you. I was hungry.
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
I know you do.
Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
No.
You don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You just haven't met the right person.
No. I haven't. Have you?
He wants a reconciliation.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Gotcha.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Well, don't look at mine!
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Getting married.
To him? He's a sick freak.
He's passionate.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Marylin! Listen to me.
But why him?
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
No, that's not all.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Howard is a beautiful person.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
Have you tried the duck?
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
To victory.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
Hello?
Yes? Marylin?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Marylin? When did I say...?
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
Screw you, asswipe!
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
Okay Miles.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Thank you.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
From a -- girlfriend.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Is that you?
Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
Hmmm...
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She never particularly cared for me.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her type. She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
And here I thought my mother was...
Your mother was.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
We're damaged goods.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something off about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our deficiencies very early on. Maybe...
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
Friends?
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
What is it Miles?
I want... I want to...
I want to be your -- your wife.
Huh?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Yes.
You do?
No.
Do you want to sleep on it?
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Yes. Again.
I have a watch.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Oh Miles!
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
But?
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a married couch.
Honey, I could sit...
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous Guy rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Well, I suppose I could girly it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Good.  Are those foods?
Fabric and fringe.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Miles.
I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --
Hi.
I have a surprise for you.
I bet.
You don't like me?
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
Miles? You're scaring me.
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
May I come in?
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I don't believe you have things.
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
Comfy!
What do you want?
I want to nail you ass.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
STUFF.  Got a light?
What kind of stuff?
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
Those are gifts.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
You can't prove anything.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Meaning my house.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
That's blackmail.
That's marriage.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
You have to leave the house immediately!
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Please! Leave the house.
I fell in love Miles.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
You do? You do love me?
It's a no go, Joe.
Marylin!
It's okay Joe.
Wait! He works for YOU?
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
That's true.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hello Marylin.
Hello Miles.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
It's not something I wanted either.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
You wounded me first, Marylin.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Murder!
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Pre-Castro.
I thought so.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Dogs?
Hello, Rex.
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Do you need a Tagamet?
You have some?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Sometimes I forget.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
I was devastated. Of course.
Jesus.
Please!
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
He never even asked. He just assumed --
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
She did a Harriman.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Miles Massey.
Do you know him?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Who's she?
Maybe.
We do have a man for you.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Well what does he want?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Lilly's up.
Oh, God!
Every week --
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
So where are you now?
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Shit.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
You're not...
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Hello Miles.
I want to be exposed.
Is this Ming?
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Right.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
But you're going through with it?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
Well, that's about to change big time.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
I guess.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Herb wants to see me?
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Heh heh.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Did Marylin end up with money?
I don't have a pre-nup
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Where does that leave us?
Mr. Rexroth.
Rex, please.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Thank you.
Now Rex.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Mm.
But then... But then...
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Ah.
You know what I mean when I say it.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
I don't know. I can assume...
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
Nothing?
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
Well -- is that possible?
What's Kirshner?
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Nothing.
And she has...?
Video.
What the fuck...?
Wrigley!
Sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Is she going through with it?
What do you think?
What are they?
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Miles -- why so angry?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
HA!
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
What...?
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
Wrigley?
Miles.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Do you have it?
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
Extinguish?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Who's Patty.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Who's Rex's guy?
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her.
OhÃ¹MaryÃ¹
How is she?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and meÃ¹those things give me a stiff pain.
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much ifÃ¹
NoÃ¹no. What the deuce do I want toÃ¹
Mr. Warne?
Come in. Sit down.
I should do this.
Do what?
This.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Yes, I knowÃ¹butÃ¹
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
The reward.
Who said anything about a reward!
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here forÃ¹
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
You're a peculiar chap.
We'll go into that some other time.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem toÃ¹
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
YeahÃ¹with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
That's an evasion.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every dayÃ¹whether it's coming to her or not.
Do you love her?
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
What's this about not eating?
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Why don't you put me in chains?
I might.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
You ought to know why. BecauseÃ¹
Because marrying that fool King Westley isÃ¹
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
Where are you taking me?
South America!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You only met him once .
You talk as if he were a gigoloÃ¹or something.
Never mindÃ¹I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menÃ¹particularly if you're a shining example.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Please don't shout.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
EllieÃ¹
Oh, hello, Dad.
I knocked several times.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
Stunt?
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Nothing.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mÃ¹I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsÃ¹IÃ¹  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareÃ¹IÃ¹when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
No.
Who is he?
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
Well, if it's as serious as all thatÃ¹we'll move heaven and earth toÃ¹
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
Oh, come nowÃ¹
Ridiculous!
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Well!
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Fine man to fall in love with.
He's marvelous!
I don't know.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
No, I'll go through with it.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, whyÃ¹
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youÃ¹made your life so miserableÃ¹and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Is that his name?
Yes. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne!
Why? Do you know him?
Oh, noÃ¹no.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Oh, please, DadÃ¹
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Are you going to see him?
I suppose so.
Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsÃ¹all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
No?  Say, listenÃ¹I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministersÃ¹some of the most powerful people in the worldÃ¹but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenÃ¹if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Sock her!
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meÃ¹and maybe we'll be friendsÃ¹  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
We've done that already.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Any others?
What do they say?
Amateurs!
Don't want to talk toÃ¹don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling.  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: Let 'em topple.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
All right, let it go.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
No.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Huh?
OhÃ¹the papersÃ¹
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
You win!
Driver!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to youÃ¹  scram.
Driver!
Tell that man not to drive so fast.
Are you talking to me?
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
WellÃ¹of all theÃ¹wellÃ¹  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Why, noÃ¹IÃ¹  Yes . . . I guess I will.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
I don't want it reported!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Yes.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night isÃ¹  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
My ticket?
I found it on the seat.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.
What are you talking about?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.
Take my adviceÃ¹grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
I didn't ask for your advice.
That's right. You didn't.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
What for?
I never thought of that.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word Humility? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, Please mister
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Here, boy!
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
Beat it!
You have your nerve!  Here, boyÃ¹!
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
You're on a budget from now on.
Shut up!
Hey, BratÃ¹!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Yeah. Come onÃ¹we're stopping here for the night.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Your ego is colossal.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, butÃ¹ you've been very kind.
Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
That, I suppose, makes everythingÃ¹uhÃ¹quite all right.
Oh, this?Ã¹I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstÃ¹then the tieÃ¹then the shirtÃ¹now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that IÃ¹
Smart aleck!
Do you mind putting out the light?
Who are you?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
The pleasure is all mine.
HereÃ¹
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  YouÃ¹you had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
You'll find the showersÃ¹and thingsÃ¹right back of the second cottage.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
I can't go out like this.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
HereÃ¹take mine.
Where'd you say the showersÃ¹and thingsÃ¹were?
HeyÃ¹you're little, aren't you?
Where is the shower?
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
High time you got back.
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerÃ¹we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Nope. No complaints.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Must be the Spring.
I thought maybeÃ¹uhÃ¹believe you me told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Um. You're doing all right.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Santa Claus?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
What are you talking about?
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at youÃ¹
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
Well, you were!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
You weren't so bad yourself.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughÃ¹we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one The Great Deception.[8]
Next week East Lynne.
How about CinderellaÃ¹or a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I refuse to resign!
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
I better go over and see her.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womanÃ¹a trip like this.
Yes.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
What's the matter?
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Not as long as I'm alive.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
What do you meanÃ¹starvation?
It takes money to buy food.
Why, haven't youÃ¹?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
To New York?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
Okay. Hang on to these.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden piggy-back in years.
This isn't piggy-back.
You're crazy.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a piggy-back rideÃ¹
Yes.
Your father didn't know beans about piggy-back riding.
My uncleÃ¹Mother's brotherÃ¹had four children . . . and I've seen them ride piggy-back.
I don't think there's a piggy- back rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good piggy-back rider.
That's silly.
To be a piggy-backer it takes complete relaxationÃ¹a warm heartÃ¹and a loving nature.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
Not a one.
Show me a good piggy-back rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instanceÃ¹a natural piggy-backer.  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about piggy-back riding that heÃ¹
This looks like the best spot.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
PeterÃ¹
What?
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Well, take them off.
What!
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
What's the matter?
Oh, PeterÃ¹
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
wasÃ¹butÃ¹
But what!
was so scaredÃ¹that it scaredÃ¹
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
Sure.
What?
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Try me.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
What are you thinking about?
Really?
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
No. But I've got a penknife.
HayÃ¹in my teeth.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Raw?
Uh-huh. Want one?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youÃ¹carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught meÃ¹goodnight!
I hate the horrid stuff.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
What if nobody stops for us?
You're an expert, I suppose.
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You think it's simple, huh?
Oh, no!
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do itÃ¹
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movementÃ¹  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Clever.
Number two is a wider movementÃ¹a smile goes with that oneÃ¹like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeÃ¹and hungryÃ¹and everything looks black. It's a long movement like thisÃ¹  Ã¹with a follow through.
Here comes a car!
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
You! Don't make me laugh.
What're you going to do?
Mind your own business.
You might give me a little credit.
What for?
We don't need forty cars.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Why not? I'm hungry.
Eat a carrot.
Never!  I'm going in and ask himÃ¹
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Come onÃ¹get in.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut onÃ¹
Come on! come on!
What happened?
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!
What'd you give him for the car?
A black eye.
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Darling!
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Any luck?
What about money?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
That's swell!
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Yeah, swell.
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Nope.
Why not?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Maybe.  SureÃ¹sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'dÃ¹  Yeah, but where you going to find herÃ¹somebody that's realÃ¹somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Better go back to your bed.
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, PeterÃ¹
I hope you got your money.
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceitedÃ¹
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Goodnight, Mr. Warne.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
I'm out! I'm out!
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andÃ¹and scared.
Do you know?
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Won't I ever see you again?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Where's the bus to New York?
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busÃ¹I told them to wait!
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
When does the bus leave?
Thank you.
Husband?
Isn't he here?
Why, he'll be back.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of theÃ¹
But can't you wait until morningÃ¹
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffÃ¹much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. Fun-on-the-side Shapeley they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Get out!
Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
What's that?
I've been thinking about you.
Eight o'clock.
Just your imagination.
Yeah? Where?
Thanks.
Huh?
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeÃ¹unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same.
Collect?
Don't accept any more.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with thatÃ¹
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles.
Get out of here!
Joe, listenÃ¹
Don't Joe me.
Okay, Joe. ListenÃ¹you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnÃ¹anytime I ran into a story that looked goodÃ¹I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
That's it.  I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsÃ¹and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
What's the thousand bucks for?
What!
Never mind . . . ListenÃ¹suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Huh?
That she's going to marry somebody else.
You're drunk.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
I'd put you there myself.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
I am, Joe.
You!
Yeah.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Well, I'll beÃ¹
Listen, PalÃ¹you've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone.  A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnÃ¹then something comes alongÃ¹messes up the finishÃ¹and there you are.
Yeah, where am I?
When you sober upÃ¹come in and see me.
Thanks, Joe.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Listen, manÃ¹I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
What?
Well, you got one now. Ã¹Come on, fill 'er up.
You send telegrams here?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Mush. Mush.
Send it collect.
Collect.
Well, you're two up on me now.
Huh?
There's a seat over there for you.
What's the idea?
Wife?
Yeah. Come onÃ¹come on!
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'Ã¹you knowÃ¹to make things pleasant.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.
Say, BuddyÃ»
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
Thanks.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
That's right.
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
YeahÃ¹wouldn't it?
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
What?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Why?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
What's on your mind?
Five G'sÃ¹or I crab the works.
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking toÃ¹
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Huh?
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
WhyÃ¹noÃ¹
YeahÃ¹the big boyÃ¹the Boss of the outfit.
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up withÃ¹
Sh-sh-shÃ¹! Soft pedal, you mug!Ã¹before IÃ¹ What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingÃ¹and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Yeah ?Ã¹How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Where do you live?
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
You love them, don't you?
Oh, gee, MisterÃ¹you wouldn'tÃ¹you ain't thinkin' aboutÃ¹
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
If you don'tÃ¹Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
No.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
Sure. Anything you say.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Elaine.
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ask Simon.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Elaine, what happened to us?
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
If that's the way you want it.
Ted!  What are you...?
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Ted, we're taking off!
Let me by, Elaine.
Ted.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, please be careful.
I mean until we start to burn up.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
That was very well put, Ted.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
You mean...
What will happen to him, Ted?
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
Now!
Ted, the lever!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Look up, sunshine
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
So mentally ill?
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Don't be too long.
Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.
That's my girl.
Have fun tonight?
Tons
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Roger.
Simon, what's happening?!
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
My career is shot.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Maybe.
Simon, what are you saying?!
Yes, sir.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
That's not possible.
That's okay, ROK.
Go ahead.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Request; life support systems check.
Put your right foot there --
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
I'm sure.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
He's carrying a bomb.
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Captain Oveur?
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Don't try to stop me!
Are you on the Mercury mission?
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Then Elaine was right.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
I don't think so.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Thanks for the message.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Hey Bleek.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Cool.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I don't know...
I'm pregnant.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
I'm supposed to be running.
I know.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
So that's cool with you, then?
Whose idea was it?
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Charisma?
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Okay, cool.
I'll try to drop by later.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I miss it too.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Really? What are they like?
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Is that normal?
Oh. That's a relief.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Jesus, Bleek.
Well, I do.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
We could get back together too.
Were we together?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I don't like Katrina.
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Um, hi?
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
You up for it?
For. . . ?
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
What?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, Oh
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
No...
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
Wait, let me take that.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Yeah. That was me.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
What, you mean as friends?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
I try really hard, actually...
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, Junebug MacGuff
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
It does?
Wizard!
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Mine too.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Can we make out now?
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Yup.
Yup.
Yup.
I don't really know anything about it.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
What? I'm not made of stone.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
Nails? Really?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Oh, God...
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
No.
Cool it.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
The term deliver is so weird. Can we not say deliver?
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
You don't know anything about me!
We don't even have a dog!
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Wow, dream big!
Oh, go fly a kite.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
I'm a junior.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
No.
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Both pilots!
Surely you can't be serious.
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...all together!!!
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Viscera?
Blood and guts.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Shut up.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.
Oh.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Yeah.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
When was this, like '96?
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
You weren't even alive!
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Yeah.
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Why aren't you at work?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
No, more commercial stuff.
Like what?
Oh.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
I wrote that.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
You're kidding!
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
No, he's the dad.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
Junk?
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
Yeah?
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
What is it?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing Superstar by the Carpenters.
Hey, I like this.
You don't have to do that.
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
The Wizard of Gore?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Uh, thanks.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
You're something else.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Why? What the big deal?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Why?
Cold feet.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Cute?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Consider it your musical education.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Is Vanessa here?
Cool.
Come on, I have something for you.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Surely there must be something you can do.
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
I actually know this one.
You do?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What are you?
I don't know.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
What?
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
No.
What's the matter?
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
But I thought you'd be cool if...
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
God, you're so young.
Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
You should try Adderall.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Really? Fingernails?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Vanessa, right?
George Zipp said that?
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
Can I take your coats?
Sure.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
You found us in the Penny Saver?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Room with a toilet, got it.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Oh really?
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
I went to the doctor today.
Is the baby okay?
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
What...
Oh my God...
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying Hi
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Wow! It's magical.
Juno? What's going on?
Nothing.
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Congrats.
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
You're pregnant?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
What?
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
State trooper?
Fallacy.
Hearsay.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Excuse me?
Hi Dad.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
You mean like couples?
Yeah, like people in love.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Dad, no!
Please stop now.
Tore up from the floor up?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
I sort of already have.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
What?!
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Or...
Thundercats are go!
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Only the one in my pants.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Unfortunately, yes.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
That is sick, man.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Aha! You love him.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
It was magnificent, man!
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
There are ads? For parents?
Oh yeah! Desperately Seeking Spawn. They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Look at this one Wholesome
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
You're not listening to me.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
All right, how about this one? Healthy
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Certainly.
I'm pregnant.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Or stage parents!
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Share the love, Tits!
Hly shht!
What?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
You sound shocked or something.
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Right, seriously.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as Keith
Keith's hot.
Eww, he's all beardy!
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
You don't say.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
So. What's that thing?
A Pilates machine?
What do you make with that?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
You guys are playing music?
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
He had fish.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
They're yellow.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called nesting.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
You should read the book. I even flagged the daddy chapters for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
And I disagree.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Hm.
Can you see it?
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
She answered our prayers.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
What would be a good time for you?
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Like what? Be a rock star?
Don't mock me.
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it collaborative divorce. It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
We're actually, finally doing this?
Looks like it, yeah.
Have you found a place to stay?
Yeah, downtown.
It's a loft.
Aren't you the cool guy?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
He had fish, too.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
No.
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine!
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Tell me something true.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Your war record? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
You expect me to believe that?
But if you'll just give me...
Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I love you, Elaine.
I love you.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
You got a telegram from headÂ¡quarters today.
Headquarters!? What is it?
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
What's his problem?
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Rain.
And a little ice.
And a little ice!
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
But Ted, you're the only...
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Ted...
Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
The gear is down.
See them, Elaine?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
Answer the question, Patrick
We have a visitor.
We'd better get back now.
Who wants to be first?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be occupied.
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
What?
Thank you.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
No. No thank you.
That ' s completely adorable!
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
The cockpit? What is it?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Wait I...
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
That's right.
I have a 4.0.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
That's not what's important.
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
Sort of.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Who could better understand than me?
How?
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
No!
I believe you! Don't worry.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
No.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
His dead body with a bullet in it.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Did you hear a shot fired?
No. I was in the shower.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
I guess.
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Where you got in the shower.
Yes.
Yes.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Because they got wet.
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
Dewey Newcomb?
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.
Tell him, Paulette.
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Thank you!
Is everything okay?
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but --
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
So everything you just said --
Yes, I am.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my career?
What's going on?
Why didn't you call me?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
See?
You can't even imagine.
Spill.
After you went to all that trouble?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's I met someone else. Move out.
What'd you do?
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
No!
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Is she as pretty as you?
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is the one?
Definitely! I love him!
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
You ready?
No.
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
God, that felt great!
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
No. Sometimes I say Okay instead of Fine.
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
What's the point?  Look at me.
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
Good one.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
I'm so happy for you!
How'd it go at the trial?
Great. Donovan actually said the words Good work
You can't go home!
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
Uh -- family.
I'm her sister.
Delta. Gamma.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Really? Thanks.
I know. He has it sent out.
You're kidding!
Really?
What?
Yes, you are.
Yes, he is.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
You guys are so sweet!
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
You think?
Too demure?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Thank you. I love you, too.
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
So?
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Here. You're gonna need this.
Your scrunchie?
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
Elle, do you know what happened on Days of Our Lives yesterday?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Power yoga?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
Josh proposed!
No way --
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
I will...
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Not yet.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
You have Stromwell.
Did she do that to you, too?
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
Good luck.
Thanks again for your help!
Don't ask.
I wasn't gonna --
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She's completely untrustworthy.
Why?
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
But maybe it's not what you think.
But maybe it is --
How do you figure?
Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.
Maybe not to your face...
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
She's not!
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
How can you still believe she's innocent?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
And you know this for a fact?
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, Oh
You're serious?
Okay, how would it work?
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
You really think I'm attractive?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
What?!
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
Hey --
I'm quitting.
Whoa -- Why?
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
What're you talking about? You earned it --
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.
Oh, my God!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Are you asking me on a date?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
So Friday at eight?
Someone missed you.
Is he the only one?
What do you think?
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
No -- it's just -- not me.
I just don't understand what went wrong --
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Almost.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Really --
What're you doing here?!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Neither.
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
I did?
I don't know --
I do.
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Maybe she found him like that.
Of course, I do!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
You're beautiful.
So are you!
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
And I fully support that.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
I completely agree.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
C'mon. Let me take you home.
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
East coast people are different.
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
No, silly. I go here.
You go where?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
What, like it's that hard?
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
Good. Good.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Now I am.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
I didn't mean --
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
You look -- nice.
Thank you.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Pink ones.
See?
Thanks for the backup.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Really?
In court. On opposing sides.
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
Where?
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
She's naked.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Hovering?
Elle?
It's not a Theta --
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
You're right. Phew!
Cunnilingus?
Let's all go! Road trip!
Why?!
Yeah, luckily.
Pull up next to him!
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Enough!
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Was that your sister?
Funny.
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
ADRIAN!
Please, get out of my mind!
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Let her go.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
Maybe try the opposite of that.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My mom wasn't a goat?
An angel?
Wow. What... what did she look like?
How come you're not older?
Angels don't get any older, son.
Where did you meet my father?
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Well tell her I said hi back.
How did you see me?
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Valerie's crying!
She's so nice.
Yeah, you do...
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
A speech impediment?
What is it?
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
It would be so okay.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
You're already there...
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
No.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
Okay, bro
It's not me, moron.
Oh. Sorry.
Makin' friends already.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
That pain is hunger.
So far, so good. Now what?
Put it in your mouth.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
But those are my roommate's sodas... Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
Release the evil?
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
I didn't murder anybody
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
I think you're looking at him.
This is baloney!
He superimposed your head onto Scarface.
Everything's fine, pop.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Yes, Jimmy.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Now everybody sit down.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
I mean... tough break.
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
Now that was an experience. You are only coming through in waves. That line blows my mind every time.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I was just playing with you.
You're a good devil, Dad.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
How bad?
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
So go get 'em, Dad!
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
No. This can't be happening.
Son, just do your best.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
You came through, Nicky.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
That's a pretty brassiere.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it.
Beast.
Hey...
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
You're not saying it's up to me?
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
Which way did he go?
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
See ya, fellas.
All right...
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Good idea... kill me.
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
I'll just go to Heaven.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Adrian?
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
You think I'm a tourist?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
The South.
Really?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Why are you laughing?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
My dad's an optometrist.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
You have a dog? What kind?
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
School?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
My perfume?
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Sometimes, sure.
Good. I was concerned.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Basically, yeah.
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
What?
What was that?
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
What were you thinking coming here?
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Valerie?
Are you dead?
No.
Why would you be floating?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
What do you mean, possessed?
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Yes...
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
We're going to Jersey?
East Rutherford.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head...
I have to, Valerie.
Nicky!
That was Cassius!
From my dad's side of the family.
Do me.
I love you.
Yes. What is rent?
No.
Yeah. The deep South.
I don't know.
It looks like the work of a brother...
If it's Cassius, yes.
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
That just hurt a lot.
Hey...
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
I don't know?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Yeah.  I guess.
You think?
Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
We're the government, Cowan.
You think we're nuts.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
From now on, you'll respond only to the name Jay. You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Do have any idea what I just said?
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
What do we do?
What the hell does that mean?
Out of focus?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Yeah ... ?
Say it
What?
Scientific American?  Really?
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Come again?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
The what?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Really nice wheels, by the way.
How's Dee?
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Kay?  What's your 20?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
He's gone, too.
Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
They're gone.
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Actually, I don't know...
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
How'd you know?
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Then Guillermo says, If you go any lighter
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
What are you talking about?
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
No thank you.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
What's 'incidentals?'
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Is it a good room?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Yeah. Take it.
So?
Is it the good room?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
What if I gave you forty?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Where's the place to go tonight?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
See you later.
So, wait, you're from where?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I don't get it. What do you do?
So you're models?
Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
No more.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
She's, uh, sleeping.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
What's wrong, baby?
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Chloe?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Mommy's not home?
What time is it there?
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Where were you?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Oh my god. What happened?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
Oh, please.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Who's watching the baby?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I'm ready.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
I feel weird asking him.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Yeah? You sure?
Go.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Ho's a good guy --
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
I'll support you.
With what?
Max offered to stake me.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
I never promised you anything.
How could you let her see this?
Goodbye, Bobby.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
Take her.
What'd you say?
I want you to take her with you.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
I said no touching.
Get your hands off of her.
Your dance is over.
I don't get it.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Draw.
What's your record at?
5-5-1.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Yeah, sure.
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
She'll be out in a minute.
C'mon girl. Eat up.
Get away from her.
Excuse --
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
Yeah. Where is he?
He making the drop?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
What's his name?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
So, when's the drop.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
How bad is it?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
When's it going down?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
So what do we do?
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Where is this happening?
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
No.
Yeah?
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Ruiz tied in out there?
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Heard of them.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Where we going?
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
How so?
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
That it?
That's it.
This is it.
Where's Ricky.
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
You bet the ponies?
Me? No. Not really.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Why?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Pshhh...
A million. Easy.
She was fast, huh?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
That's why they call it the smart money.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They were out of line --
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
I'll work it off.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
So, that's it. I'm out?
Then what are you saying?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I don't understand.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
No.
I know.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Yeah. Sorry.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Yeah.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Ruiz knows about this?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
He'll work it off.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
You vouch for him?
Yeah. Sure.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
No. Okay. I'll think about it.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Yeah.
Yes.
What is it?
You want --
Yes. Goodbye.
There won't be a next thing.
Take a few days --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
What drill?
We get it. We're sorry.
Good morning.
Nah, man...
A bad heart.
What's the plan?
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
Bobby.
What's that?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Where is the Soho Grand?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
No. Just the cross streets.
No. That's cool, man.
'Trustafarians?'
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Yeah.
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Taken care of?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
It's important.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Can you check?
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Thanks.
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
What about boxing?
What are you saying?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it's not a winning record.
Don't be shitty.
How am I being shitty?
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I'll page you.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Yeah. I know the number.
I know the number.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I got no idea.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I will.
I'll page you with the number.
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
I thought you hate that club.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
Fuck them.
Shhh...
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
He implied it.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Bullshit...
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
You wanna go right now?
I'll beat your ass --
Sorry coach.
Sorry coach.
We look good this year.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Fuck him.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
What are we delivering?
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I like it.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
Nice work.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
What? Did she say something?
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
Who's driving her?
I don't know.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Right here's fine.
Is that the woman from..?
She really liked the kitchen.
To keep?
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
Pretty nice.
What's the movie?
I'll get the girl.
Nah, don't bother --
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
No. Look. There.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
You sure?
Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
Who you calling?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
How much is it?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
How much was it?
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Oh really. Why's that?
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
What are you doing?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
What exactly did they say?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
They didn't say an address?
Nothing else.
Nothing.
How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.
So they said more than the address.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
This is bullshit, man.
What the fuck do you...
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
Don't even start.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Motherfucker...
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
I mean, that's what I heard --
You got something to say --
You know this guy?
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
I don't know.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
What did I 'get?'
Yeah. What vibe?
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
You would think.
Yeah.
You happy?
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You too?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Fuck this.
Where do you think you're going?
You fucking nuts?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
You got that right.
Fine.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English.
What the hell did you do?
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
What the fuck was that about?
She was jonesing for me.
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
What's up?
He wants to see us now.
Where?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
We're getting whacked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
What are you doing.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
Put that shit out...
C'mon, man...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
Nothing, man.
Let's do it.
I'm your soldier.
Let's check out the penguins.
The what?
The penguin house.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
Did you hear what he just said?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Wanna bet?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
It was six in the fucking morning.
Float me a hundred bucks.
Why?
You're out of money?
No.
What do you have left?
Eighty.
Eighty five.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
You did?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
What about it?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
I'm sorry...
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
It's gonna be fine.
No more, man.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
So what do we do?
Let's just go now and wait.
Three and a half hours?
I don't want to take any more chances.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Where do you get this shit?
You're not getting a gun.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Easy...
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
Dude, we were practically made...
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
No. I'll wait here.
I'll be a minute.
Hey, boys.
Tom. How's it going?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
C'mon...
Fuck...
What do you mean 'kinda?'
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
You want your surprise?
Well, come on then. It's back here.
I didn't do anything --
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
Ugh...
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Yes.
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
Where's Spa.
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
How do you know it's not drugs?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
You strapped?
'Strapped?'
It means you got a gun?
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Why? What I say bad?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
What? Why am I bad?
See you later.
Stop.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
Ow, shit...
Watch it...
I'm half Irish.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
And where is...?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
No?
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Does anyone want another?
What do you want?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
That shouldn't be a problem.
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
No, really, mate?
Here...
Here they are, then.
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Come, now. You just got here.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Yeah.
Good morning.
Nah, man...
Word.
Yeah.
So whenever we want...
So you're our own private guy?
You know my pager number?
A lot of Persians?
I call 'em wiggers.
Can I borrow a piece of --
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
We're going to New York?
Yes. You're going to New York.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
That money is your per diem.
And where do we bring it?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Keys.
What?
What about my keys?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Tell me.
Don't worry. I get it.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
But, Max --
We're square.
Yes, sir.
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
No. I'll take a strega.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
It's a digestif.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
She poured it for --
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
No...
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We're your guys.
Who's gonna outfit us?
The Red Dragon.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Yeah.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Edinburgh.
And where might that be?
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
I am.
A rose by any other name would --
Dip?
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
I'll get it.
Who's up for a night on the town.
What?!
Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a -  non-smoker?
Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I'm likin' you guys better
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
He's parted his moorings.
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
They give you copies to burn.
Never this close.
Just one for a start.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
How you, Radar?
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Home.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
That's right.
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Back home.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
No.  Or why you should.
Don't you use olives?
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Pour one for Painless.
Miss you, Walt.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
Look at that right eye.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Not enough to be a pro.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Or her figger.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
Y'all mind the store.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
What the hell's going on here?
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Us. Lead us not into...
What?
And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
Perfectionist.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Duke Forrest.
You got directions?
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
I got some.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore Ã»  House. You in the market Duke?
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
He can't take much more time on the table.
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
We been had.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
What's that?
The chest-cutter.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
Sixteen times.
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Call Dago Red.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
What do you think, Trapper?
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
Never mind. Forget it.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
When will he be able to write?
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
An application to Androscoggin College.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Yeah, if I can.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
When?
Any time. Whenever we want.
Be right with you.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
We could steal one of the choppers.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
I was just asking...
You betcher ass, Dad.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
And there it is.
Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
Black capsule.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
An eternal damnation.
We stand behind all our work.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
No, no, that one.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Look.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
What's the age of consent in this country?
Is he out?
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Radar!
For you, Trapper.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
It's in pretty deep.
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
I don't feel anything.
Oh, Jesus.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
I don't get it.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
He can move in here with us.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Not necessarily.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
That's right. We work well together.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
The bastards outconned us.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
See you.
Hang in there.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
It isn't always this rough?
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Something else we have in common.
Same here.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Ayuh.
Of course not.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Maria...
You're leaving tomorrow?
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
I didn't mean with me.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Why would he do that?
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Duke...
I didn't have much choice.
Yeah!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
They missed the boat.
Glad to help.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
The one and only.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
What's wrong with him?
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
There's only one worth noticing.
You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
Homosexuality.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
No, never in the slightest.
Just in dreams?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
In the direction you want to go.
You guys got any black capsules?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
You can cut the bow.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
The blonde dish.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
About that chest-cutter...
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
First decent idea you've had in a month.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
You mean who hit who?
I did. First and only blow. So far.
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
What's the bastard really like?
That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
Never mind.
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
Now?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
How is he?
Arterial silk.
Boys, we're home free.
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperÃ¹and forty heads are chopped off!
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterÃ¹and stick by it?
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Huh?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
With all of it?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!
Well, all those guys in the bleachers thinkÃ¹
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Yes!
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- belliedÃ¹
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
No.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Who?
John Doe. The one in there.
Who?
John Doe, the one in the speech.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Hello, John.
Hello.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's goingÃ¹
John Doe Clubs? What for?
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Uh-huh . . .
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Uh-huh.
Can I help you pack?
Do you care if I sit down out here?
No.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
About me?
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Yeah, that's the one.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
I guess so. Then what happened?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Look, JohnÃ¹what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: Love thy neighbor
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, butÃ¹there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Did you write this?
You didn't?
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Yes, sir.
Thirty dollars.
Money.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
A hundred dollars!
Thank you very much for everything.
Better let me talk to him.
Oh!
A third party?
John! I'm so glad to see you. IÃ¹I was terribly worried.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
The Websters!
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
What?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Huh?
You bet I will, Ma.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersÃ¹start arguments.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
The letter.
What letter?
The letter from John Doe.
Oh!
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
There is no letter.
We'll get a handwriting expert toÃ¹  What!
Say that again.
There is no letter. I made it up.
You made it up.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
In what man!
John Doe.
What John Doe?
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, geniusÃ¹ Now, look. Suppose there was a John DoeÃ¹and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
A deal?
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
So?
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
John Doe.
What John Doe?
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
Well, you're catching on.
Who, for instance?
Anybody! Er, erÃ¹Beany'll do!
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Plus a bonus.
What bonus?
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
Looks all rightÃ¹
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
I wish he had a family, though.
That's our man. He's made to order.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Hurry up, Pop.
Oh.
All right, boys, here he is.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Well, maybe you're right.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomÃ¹under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract?
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Oh!
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
I got it all ready. Here.
Okay, fellows.
Take it easy, John Doe.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Awwwww!
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledÃ¹the Governor's starting a libel suitÃ¹what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyÃ¹and they insist on seeing him.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayÃ¹here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
What's the idea?
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Thank you.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Colonel!
Has he been here?
Have you seen him?
Where's Connell?
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
I missed you.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Had any schooling?
Baseball?
Where'd you play?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
Where is she?
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Did you find her?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Go out and find her!
Hello! . . . Yeh?
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl thereÃ¹
Shut up!
Ann! Say, why didn't yuhÃ¹
What?
Look!
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Yeah, Boss?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Both of 'em?
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
. . . Tubby?
Help yourself.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Who?
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Who are they?
Sure. Mostly often.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Sure, you are.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
John Doe Club?
I trust him.
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matterÃ¹are you falling? Come here.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
You betcha.
Listen, palÃ¹this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Yeah. It certainly is.
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Sure.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'dÃ¹
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall forÃ¹
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Well, I don't get it.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Well, I'm stuck with two and twoÃ¹but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Yes. Sure.
How?
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesÃ¹but stay out o' newspaper business!
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
What are you doing up here then?
How about family? Got any family?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big ShotÃ¹you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
That's a lie!
That's a lie! ListenÃ¹don't believe what he says . . .
That's got nothing to do with it!
Yes! I was paid! But theÃ¹
What difference does that make?
No, I didn't write it, butÃ¹
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing startedÃ¹
Thanks.
It's for Ann . . .
She isn't?
Oh!
Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for theÃ¹
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Well, I was thinking thatÃ¹Yeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
What do you mean, too bad?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get aÃ¹
Racket? What do you mean?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
How?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hello, guys.
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
You're my hero.
Deal.
Phoney Frank? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Yeah, okay.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
You want me to go up with you?
Good. I don't want to be late.
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Touch of the flu.
Who's controlling your mind?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Tell me what's wrong.
How can I help you with the particles?
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Is that where you're family lives?
I need to get something straight first.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Manual or automatic?
You got it.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
...a car.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
What's the suspect's name?
I have to go face to face.
What do you got on Korda?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
Yep.
Is that all?
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
Satisfied?
It's all there.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
Sorry... Habit.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
If you say so.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
How do you feel after a shooting.
Like it had to be done.
I've rarely shot anyone.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I know.
Try to remember that.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Recruited you from where?
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
Furthest point I could find from New York.
You don't like New York?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
You'd never been out of New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
How did you like Toronto?
It was okay.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
You caught me on an up day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for fast advancement.
I'm not sure.
We could fill it with water.
Not the ones I'm at.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
You got a girlfriend?
Why? You like my ass?
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
I don't gamble.
You living together?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Explain how that works.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Oh, city girl. Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
We see each other every couple of months.
Every couple of months, huh?
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Do you really?
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
Lesson two, Dead Eye... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
I think I can handle that one.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
I think so.
First things is, don't say, What's going on? Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you.  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
No.
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
I can't do that.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
So what do I say to this guy?
You could say something like,  Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
I'm not good at lying.
It's against my nature.
You know the ten commandments?
Yes.
You tell me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Yes.
To save lives.
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
Okay, stop.
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
Why did he do it?
Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
You know why I like the track?
You're a compulsive gambler?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
I do.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
Fine.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
I'm just practicing my lying.
Still needs work.
The 6 horse is last.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run late!
The 6 horse is still last.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
They need to run first and second?
Yeah, first and second.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
The jockey!
COME ON, RUSSELL!
We won!
How much you wanna bet?
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
How long you been coming here?
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
Occasionally you lose.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
There's your answer. He's smart.
He's cutting down the visibility.
And doing a very good job of it.
He's got the girl.
What the fuck is going on.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
You're crazy.
Pull up alongside.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
How many have you lost?
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
So what do you want to do?
That's a chance I gotta take.
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Good question.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Stay put.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Which apartment?
Have you evacuated anyone?
Is the hostage injured?
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
I know how you feel, Ray.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Let me show you something, Ray.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
My name's Scott Roper.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
I worship you.
You worship yourself.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Greg.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
Please. I'm begging you.
Hey.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Maybe you should be.
You heard.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Can I come in?
That a new picture?
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
You think I didn't need you?
Ronnie...
I wanted to get this out of the way.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
As a matter of fact, I do.
It's already started.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
And it's hard to get.
What do you think?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Yeah that's it.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Scottie...
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
Just now.
What's to discuss?
How's Paco doing?
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
You like this place?
It's very nice.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
Yeah?
...Let me just show you.
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
And you think he'll...
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Use your imagination.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Scottie, Scottie...
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Stay here, don't move.
Do it!
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
A deeper level?
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
Scott...
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
...the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the M word.
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
You crazy? With all those people around?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
The hell I am!
Prude.
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
Stay up there, Girl...
SHIT!
Tell him to give me a raise.
He says, Thank you very much.  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Roper.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Depends. What's up?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Define concern.
Your concern is heartwarming.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
You let us worry about that.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
And a car.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
The car is part of the deal.
What happened to your Trans Am?
Repoed this morning.
I'll provide you with transportation.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
I can't do that.
I want to be put on this case.
Who's running it?
Roper...
Who's running it!
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Any verification on numbers.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself Joe. There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
What have you promised them?
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Are these yours?
Come on!
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
I don't know. I guess it was...
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Yeah...before your time.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting...  That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Switch hands.
Left-handed, he was funny. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that.  And then the nightmares just...stopped.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Five CC's.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's not Stu any more. The Stu I love is gone!  He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Uhh - martini?
Stu Miley.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
I didn't say anything.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare you right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Bend over?
DEATH!!
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay.  I guess I'm yours now.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Back? You're sending me back?
Death! Thank you!
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Herb. I have to go.
I got the ring.  Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - right now.  I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piÂ±ata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop.  Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
No. I want to give him more. I want to give him a massive dose.
I don't want to stop the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to scare him awake.
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the house!  This is an honor. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like caviar, man. You da shits!!
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm okay. Until I can get out of here...
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
It's a special kind of party. A farewell party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare.  They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a putz - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's one thing you might try. Only one guy in history ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, very few people have done it.
Hyp, I'll do anything.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got big plans for that body of yours!
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
YOU SET ME UP!!
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
But why me? Why'd you pick on me??
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Monkeybone...!?
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons??
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
You're acting kind of...odd.
You sure this is...medically advisable?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
Stu? Is that you? Where did you go?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
You're wearing a topcoat, Stu. - Where are your pants?
It looks so...new.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
He called me Doc.
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be us. Home. Alone!  I have something I have to give you.
Can't you give it to me later?
Yeah, I could, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Who?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is good luck. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
What's the bad part?
I might wake up.
If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
Did we just - hit something?
I don't think so.
Are you okay??
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
I'd better go report this...
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
You're not helping.
Stu?
How was it? I don't recall.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
What's the matter?
When'd you get in?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
The ring...
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
It's too soon even to - talk about that!
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Kitty...my situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her what Monkeybone is up to??
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
You have humiliated me in public for the last time.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You gotta love me.
I am not. And I don't gotta.
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my species.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
What union?
The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better watch your ass!
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come he goes back and I stay here?
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
He got an E-ticket. Where's mine? When do I get to wake up??
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
I've been stuck down here for months. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna kick ass!
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...doodle.
Stu... It's a party.
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...apply. It was different then. I was depressed. My life is great now. I'm in love!
I'm so dumb! I deserve to die -
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumÃš. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Stu, you have my absolute confidence. Â¡- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter -  It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
All right. You can come.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride!  Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Where'd he go??
Stu...Stu...
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
Stu...LOOK!
What?
Isn't that Lulu?
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Pirate -- no question.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Who are you?
That's going to be fun.
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
Yes, IÃ¹
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Are you married?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Next, please.
No. Are you?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Why not?
Would you like to go for a walk?
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Your Honor!
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
No!
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
No! I resigned last week!
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Yes!
Are these the articles?
Yes!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Yes!
Are they true!
NO!!
But they did take place?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Yes, but IÃ¹
That's all, Miss Bennett.
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Oh, thank you!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
What's that got to do with it?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
What's that got to do with it?
Yes!!!
You fainted.
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
What happened?
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
Feel better now?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh - uh - nothing.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
No. That is, I didn'tÃ¹  Until I met you. I like talking to you, thoughÃ¹  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Really?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
Oh, I don't mind.
I enjoy it.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Sure. I met you.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman ifÃ¹
What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
What are they going to do?
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Uh-huh.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Yes.
Yeah, let's.
It's wonderful.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Huh?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
That depends on what they see.
Now, what do you see?
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as PresidentÃ¹  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Why don't you try?
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
What's that?
Oh, I don't know.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]  Except you, of course.  People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live  Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Really?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
I've often thought about going back.
You have?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: No matter what happens
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
He played in the town band, too.
He did? I play the tubaÃ¹
Yeah, I know.
What did he play?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
He did?
Yes. I can do Swanee River. Would you like to hear me?
Sure!
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Sure. I can sing Humoresque.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do Humoresque with you.
It had better be good.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
I'd like to read it some time.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
You threw them out!
Yes, if it isn't too late.
I'll get my hat.
Ready?
Thank you.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Let's just walk, okay?
All right.
Mary, I'm going home.
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
I don't blame you.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
No, I don't mind.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Well, here we are again.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Mary - I - excuse meÃ¹
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Yes, of course.
Hello, Mary?
Oh, hello darling.
What's the matter, hon?
Nothing.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Good night.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Uh-huh.
People have been crucified before.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Yeah, then what?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
The guy's balmy.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
You're a fool, Babe.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Running away is no solution.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
You're acting like a school girl.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Hello.
Look, I can do it!
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can haveÃ¹
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
With pay!
Uh-huh.
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Have lunch.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Did it?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Is he really that big a sap?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
Had the boys follow us.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
When're you going to see him again?
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Sure.
With pay!  She is out the door.
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
What's bothering you, huh?
Last night he proposed to me.
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl ThatÃ¹
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and heÃ¹
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
What're you going to do?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
You're crazy! You can't do that!
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
That's the rub.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
Hello . . .
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
You try it.
Me, sir?
How's it going? Okay?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Oh, yes sir.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Stuff, sir?
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Yes, sir.
Sit over there, will you?
Me sir?
Yes.
Perfect! Perfect!
I wish you luck, sir.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
Relatives of old man Semple.
Nuisance value?
Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
This is outrageous!
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
What was that you said he was?
Your Honor, I object.
It's a lie!
But your honorÃ¹
Newspaperman?
Wants to know who the heir is.
Hang up.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorneyÃ¹
Hang up.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
That's pretty.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
See you later, kid.
I can't find him.
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Look!
That tuba player!
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-NÃ¹
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, CharlieÃ¹
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
How do you do.
How do you do.
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Why, no.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do toÃ¹
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Buffer?
Who - me? No.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
What for?
You're going to New York with us.
Will you have a cigar?
No, thank you.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
No?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Huh?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Why not? Who is he?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, thanks.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Why should you?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Huh?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Have a drink?
No, thanks.
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from Lucia.[2]
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
That's funny. Why is that?
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Only common sense.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Entertainment?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What're you talking about?
Oh.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Arthur wants to quit!
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Are those stories true?
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
But what about this Cinderella Man?
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossingÃ¹
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - Cinderella Man. You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Shut up!
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
They can have the Estate.
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
I'm Chairman?
I'm Chairman.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
We own an opera house, don't we?
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Why not?
Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.
Let him alone.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
A child? My uncle's?
Yes, sir.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
No, I mean - about my client.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Huh?
Oh. That.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Well, I don't know. IÃ¹
Well, I play the tuba.
No.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that IÃ¹
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the Cinderella Man was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Oh, the poet? Where?
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
That ought to be fun.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
Don't pay any attention to her.
Now you keep out of this!
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
What is your name?
South Dakota - north?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Is she home?
Yeah. What?
You meanÃ¹  Ã¹by the neck or something?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Tails tonight, sir?
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Yes, sir.
What do you think you're doing?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Yes, sir.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
No, sir.
Excuse me. What did you say?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
You're Walter, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
Prairie? Oysters?
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Oh, I do too, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
What two policemen?
The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!
Please!
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Looking for?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Who?
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
But she's on the telephoneÃ¹
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
What, sir?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yeah.
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
Yes, sir.
Shall I call the police, sir?
No!  What do you want!!
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
Me more than most.
Why are they ganging up against me?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
How did they threaten you?
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Hmm?
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Really? You think so?
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
the argument had nothing to do with it.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
I had ordered some books. The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written.
One hundred books?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
What happened?
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
You must have been concerned.
Doubtful. What did he say?
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't worked for him for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
Take your time.
You can go out there if you like...
There's no shame in getting a little therapy, right, Doc?
Mr. Cook.
Uh-huh.
What's that?
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Why's that?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
A friend?
No, not really.
Not any more.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
Right now?
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
My approach?
How do you mean?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
The real you.
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
What just happened?
That ' s what I thought
I see.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Why not?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Good, then go.
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Henry!
What?
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Where's your wife, Henry?
Go to hell.
I didn't hear you.
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
What?!
I was... never satisfied.
Now we're back on track.
You are so mean.
What is it?
It's a thought I had.
Should I open it now?
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
And the experiment is in here?
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
I feel like we're making real progress here.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
Do you want to come in?
Mr. Gilroy --
What brought this on?
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Nope.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, I should have spent more time at the office.
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
What do you do?
Althea hasn't told you?
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
You've done well.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
A little.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
Tastes good.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
What do you think's wrong with her?
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
You're the doctor, what do you think?
She seems very unhappy.
I do.
Yes, your honor.
I'm sorry, your honor.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Oh?
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
What?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
That's a lot of people all at once.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
What are they?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
Yeah.
Well, come on in.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
My patient had to leave early.
Does the phrase nosy have any meaning to you, Lily?
I think it's like... inquisitive.
It was Henry Follett.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
Oh, I don't know...
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
You like me. How come?
Not sure. Let me think about it.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Doc.  Ainge...
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
And the Brocketts?
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Why do you watch?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Where am I supposed to eat?
You're on your own today, honey.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
...so rich?
Doc...
Lily.
Doc.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
What it might take is... doing time.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Sure I can, Lionel.
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Hello, Lionel.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Sure.
Don't need it.
You're good.
I'm trying.
Is she a friend of yours?
Martin.
How are you?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
We're going for a walk.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Mother... go away!
Ph.D., psychologist.
That's right, the fake kind.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
No, I really don't.
Why don't you tell me?
Well... you see, the problem is --
Wow. You're something.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
What can you tell me about this?
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
What?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
No.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- Everything that's wrong with you is in your head. I suppose that's true.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
Even if you don't think it's real?
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
What would you do?
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
We'll work it out.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Can I ask you something?  Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  So what changed?
I'm not making any promises.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
Mom's such a cutie.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Something's bothering her.
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you marry beneath yourself...
Please... forgive me.
What?
Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
I've offended you!
No.
Really? What would it take?
Is this the treatment?
Sorry... I'm done.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Be specific.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Sore throat?
Uh-huh.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Where?
Life.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
I can give myself a headache instantly.
Is that like a party trick?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Yes.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Is that when you split up?
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
So whose route is this?
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
And he's where?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
You like it?
It's all right.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
That's what I like.
Which thing?
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
That's one way to put it.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
Yeah?
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
I don't know if --
Of course.
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
Of course.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
You're upset.
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
Is it something you've heard about me?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Um-huh.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
I'm glad.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I don't follow you.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Okay...
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I think so.
What was that?
Transference!
Transference.
Hello?
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
Mother...
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
I guess you saw the show...?
Which show was that?
Sofie...
Part of it. We were watching ER until someone called.
You probably got the idea.
You're not the only one...
You feel violated?
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
You deserve it.
I am irate!
But...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
What?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
Oh.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
Anything... just ask.
What is your name?
You got off easy.
Will you wait for me?
Will you be here?
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, Naomi Forever... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
What do you mean, in no time?
In maybe three or four issues.
Weekly or monthly?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
It's a big part of the show.
It's called pro bono.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Where was this?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
Have women found you attractive?
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
That's not quite what I said --
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What do you want me to see?
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
True. Should we stop them?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
Uh-huh.
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
Do you think that's what he wants?
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you
What'd he say?
He said -- Which we already knew!
What did he want you to do?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
No again?
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
Really?
He agreed?
He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
...Find the need and fill it my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
Nah... scotch.
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Is that the question?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
I understand.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
I've got three big ones.
This is great!
This is exactly what I wanted.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Don't you like this?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Good-looking woman.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Well, there's Lily.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
What?
This --
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Uh-huh.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
I wondered what happened to her...
Hey, Skip.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Yep.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
It's just a thought.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
Jerking off?
No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
Slash what?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
A doll?
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
How's it coming?
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Really?
Definitely.
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
It's not?
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
Who else knows?
Just you.
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
I can tell you anything else.
What about everything? How did this happen?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Sounds like you have several.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It wasn't the best situation.
Did you carry a gun?
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Holy shit!
Get to know your therapist.
You were messed up, man.
But look at me now...
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
At least you pulled yourself out...
Things got a lot worse.
You and Candy...?
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
All new people start with that...
What about it?
Mumford... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
And a birth certificate is enough?
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
No... no training.
Psych major?
English Lit.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
See you Thursday... regular time.
I've never brought anyone down here before.
I'm honored.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Really?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Lily.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Sorry...
I'm here for you, Doc.
I guess that makes sense.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
What?
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
Yep.
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
It's possible. I don't know about that.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
So who killed him?
We didn't think this through very well.
When was that?
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
And some sandwiches --
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
Who are you?
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
I can't.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
But in fact... you'd found it.
Me, too.
No one will believe us.
Let's do it.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
I dunno.
Hello?
Sure.
You're nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Against.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
So are you!
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Really?
Just a waitress.
Really?
Sure -- I guess.
Hi.
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Curiosity.
I'd better go.
What?
Who?
Stay away!
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Not tonight.
Hi.
Alone tonight?
Every night.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Yeah.
Sure.
That was easy.
I admire you.
Why?
It is?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
I wouldn't mind being famous.
What's your real name?
Roy.
Have you always lived here?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
It's home.
Yeah.
What have they got that we ain't got?
Me, too.
You don't seem very angry right now.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
I just want to be a superhero.
It's me.
Monica, where are you?
At the Frankenstein Center.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
I'm going inside.
What are you talking about?
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
And what if you get killed?
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
What?
Bye.
Monica!
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Good or evil, what's the difference?
You're the Sphinx.
And a skunk stinks!
When are you going to take off that mask?
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos!
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever.
Oh don't start that again --
LOOK!
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
We had an off night, that's all.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
What are you talking about?
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
And it would be the right thing to do.
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
I'm liking this.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
Have you ever seen him?
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Good point.
You sure that's how you spell it?
Yeah.
There's just not enough of us.
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
There's a big difference.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
But there's still only six of us.
SO WHAT?
So what else has Superman got?
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
GET MAD!
But I just don't feel it.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!
But she still might call!
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Not a chance!
Cover me!
With what?
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
There's a vague similarity.
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
But look at him... and look at us.
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
So why don't you just tell her!
Why not?
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
Nah.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
So you're chicken?
Who's chicken?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Or flowers.
See ya tomorrow.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Let's go.
The who?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Well they've crawled back out.
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
Shhh.
Maybe she's right.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Agents?
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Maybe there was traffic.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
Oh shut up.
Roy --
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
So where's the art?
He hasn't stolen it yet.
What's that?
Come on.
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
But... only when no one is looking.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
Firepower costs money.
Yes, Obie-wan.
You guys going to a costume party?
We're superheroes.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Are you famous?
Not yet.
Wow.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Really?
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Here you go.
Ow.
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Oh hi, Mom.
Mother... it's not what you think!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
I use it... to fight evil.
It is?
You did?
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
Hi.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
She likes you.
Definitely.
This is bad.
Who are they?
The Disco Boys.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Or both.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Sorry.
Be a Mohican.
Be a Mohican.
Shut up.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
And there's the Sphinx.
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
And a social life.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
Whatever our name is.
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
But how do we get in?
That was too close.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
It's suicide.
Oh no.
Great timing!
It's time.
May the forks be with us!
Where am I going?
Through there!
Anything you need.
That's it?
And I can go free?
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
Thanks, Unc.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Yeah.
Well, let me in.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
It's cool, but where's the water?
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
Good.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Why you say that?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
I don't know!
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
No.  Thought he was with you.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Stretch it out.
Don't move me.
I'm his cousin.
Yes you did.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Where you going?
No I'm not.
I'll do it.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What happen?
What you mean talk to her?
You know what he mean, dude.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
Not me.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
What's the green stuff poking out?
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Naw, I already ate.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Black magic.
It's about to work, just come on.
What about the dog?
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Fuck, what's his name?
Cheeco.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Nobody!
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
What's crackin'?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
Who is that?
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
This you?
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
Man, this a cool house.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Thanks for reminding me.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
I know, be still.
You straight?
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
Just a little.
I can't taste nothing.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
What?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Damn, you got a stalker.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
You don't know Baby D.
Who is that?
That's the sister.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Why?
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
So.
What you mean, so?
I walked.
You walked?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
How can they do this?
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
247
Okay, plan B.
What's the matter?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
I ain't trying to get in it.
You better stop running from that girl.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
Thanks a lot, Craig.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
I don't.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
Ain't no windows in here.
Blow.
That ain't gonna work.
It works.
Still gonna smell it.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Out the door and to the left.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
What we gonna do?
I don't know yet.
Alright, Roach, see you around.
Sorry about today, man.
You see that?
Yeah, air.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
How you know?  It could be anything.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
What's the B-G's?
You make it sound so easy.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
You go first.
You go first.
No.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Wait.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
No, man, just wait.
What about me?
You sure you don't wanna stay?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
Karla.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
My brothers won't give me a ride.
You want us to give you a ride?
I don't know.
What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
Hello, remember me?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
I just wanted to give you this.
Most definitely.
Better sooner than later.
Huh?
What are you doing here?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
You did all this for me?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I did.  Is that door locked?
It's locked.
Make sure.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Next time, page me first.
Okay.
You alright?
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Hold on.
I said hold on!
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
What is it?
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
Here I come!
Well bring yo' ass on...
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
I do.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Just hold your breath.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
You coming in?
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
Craig, remember what I told you.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
Have you seen Day-Day?
You see that?
Come on.
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Yeah, pops!
You too.
Nothing.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
Nice to meet you?
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
What up, bro?
What it say?
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
What is it?
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
That the big one, huh?
You damn right that's the big one.
You don't wanna know.
Negative...they vamped.
Today ain't my day.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
I do.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Roach, what are you doing?
R-U-S-H Intensely.
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
You could sell your Beamer.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
I know.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Let it go!
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Where's Craig?
He's inside the house?
Why did he go in the house?
Don't worry about it.  We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.
Go for it.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
This is a knock.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
And some rolling papers.
...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing.  How y'all doing?
What?!  What that mean?
I don't know.
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
Bite his ear!
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
He's a boy, dude.
Thanks for the help.
Call me.
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
20 minutes?
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
Ah damn.  Damn.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Sorry, my ass.
I don't know.
Nothing.
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Hey, what's going on?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
'Take your car?'
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
What about that ugly dog?
Need to lose some weight.
Shut yo' ass up.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
My back.
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
What you doing to my nephew?
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
I threw my back, again.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this persona?  And you don't know how to quit?
No
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Well, here are fifty francs.
From Leon.
Good evening, Anna.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, There's sabotage in the string section!
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
What are you serving?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
About what?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
I have nothing to hide.
You should. I'll show you.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
I see.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Tell me... what else did you have?
What was it like?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
An evening gown.
Evening gown?
A dress you wear in the evening.
What do you wear in the morning?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
You feel it, though.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
Just for the honeymoon.
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
Possibly.
No, that's not him...
Positively not!
That's her.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Or we can't go back to Russia!
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
That's right.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
That's another thing... it's spring.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
...des raisins de MadÃžre, des framboises...
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
We don't like Razinin.
What is it?
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
That must be the one!
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
We had to take it on account of the safe.
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
What a lovely room you have here.
How many families live here with you?
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
No, that's bad management.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Why should you be afraid?
How are things in Moscow?
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Which part of the room is mine?
Which lawyer?
You didn't get legal advice?
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
Yes, Comrade?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
With two f's, if you please.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Yes, Comrade.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
That's right.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
But, Comrades...
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Shall we tell her?
Guest?
We have opened a restaurant...
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us?
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Oh, yes, yes.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Good morning, Gaston.
That's all right.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Go to bed.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
What time have you, Gaston?
I guess it is eight forty-two.
I am, Gaston.
Have you?
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, Hey
Are they indeed? Thank you.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Count d'Algout...
That's perfect!
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is Buljanoff
We can wait.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
We can call our ambassador.
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
Leon, my little boy.
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
It is Thursday!
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
While you eat, you look at the view.
Let's do that.
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crÃžme de Bretagne...
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
But you can't...
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
Get out of here!
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
What proposition?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
Razinin.
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
What did she say about me?
I think she covered you with the parasites.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
How much does this cost?
Two thousand francs.
A week?
A day.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
A cow?
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Bad news?
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: Dine With Buljanof
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just looking around.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Right away... instantly!
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
We may have a chance.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
No, thank you.
What's that?
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
We did it with the best intentions...
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
Yes, Comrade.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
If there is anything we can do for you...
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
How are you, you three scoundrels?
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
...and Kopalski.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
That's two weeks from Thursday...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
Au revoir.
Give me another double brandy.
What can I do about it?
You want me to go in there?
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Don't hold that against me... please!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Business.
What business?
Private.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Confess what?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
You believe in our cause?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
But you had!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
I think so too.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
You're going to force us... huh?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Why should I take a chance?
On what?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
What for... why?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
You, please.
Me?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Gladly.
How long do we have to wait here?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
At what intervals does he whistle?
What?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
In other words you don't know.
No.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Can I help you?
You might hold this for me.
Love to.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
How long does it take a man to land?
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
And where are we?
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
I'll try.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Go ahead.
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
That's a strange angle.
Yes, very strange.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La BohÃžme... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
So that is your house?
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Please don't misunderstand me...
Then you don't want me to go there.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Is this what you call the butler?
Yes.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
He takes good care of that.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
What do we do now?
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Is that customary?
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
I will start with you.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
And what do you do for mankind?
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Thank you. Thank you.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
That is correct.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Thank you.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
You repeat yourself.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
Don't do it, please.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Wounded? How?
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
Do you hear that?
It's twelve o'clock.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
It's false sentimentality.
You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
Was that talkative?
No, that was restful. Again.
Thank you.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Glorious, analytical...
The telephone is ringing.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
I must go.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Let's forget that we ever met.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
You know I want to...
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
Room service speaking.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
This is a place for workmen.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
What are you after?
Must one always be after something?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
What?
Will you smile?
Why?
Just smile.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Why?
Because we are an odd couple.
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
On which boat?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Probably not.
Do you like Scotch stories?
I have never heard one.
I wish they had never met.
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon? Yes
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
I don't think so.
Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!
Not funny, huh?
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
Yes.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Yes.
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, Just a moment
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said Eight Rue du Bois... and here I am.
You see? Life can be so simple.
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
It's nine o'clock.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, What are your plans for this evening
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
Anything, Ninotchka.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
I promise... I swear.
I don't think so.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
Ninotchka, I love you.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
My darling.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
A funny story?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
Go on.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
You must, darling.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
What, darling?
Thursday.
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Comrades! Comrades!
Darling, darling... please!
I must talk to my brothers!
Shhh! Shhh!
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Comrades! Good people of France!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No speech?
No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
Are we going to build our little house?
Yes... a little white house.
All right, we'll make it red.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No! No!
No! No!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
Would that make you any happier?
Much happier.
All right.
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
Let's turn on the radio.
Radio! What is radio?
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
What shall we get? The news!
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
It's dead.
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
No music.
No, no music.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
But I can throw it out of the window.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...but big.
Who cried that one?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, Darling
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
They belong to the people.
It is their wish.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Please.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Yes, sweetheart.
So happy and so tired.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Good morning, Swana.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Did you win?
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.
Those newspaper people?
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia!
Oh, Leon!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard.
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. Caviar and Blood. Swana escapes over the ice!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Did I hear something about jewels?
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
What did he say?
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
No.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
Make it ice cold.
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That bad?  Old or young?
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Am I interrupting?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
How do you do?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Months, Swana.
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
No thanks, Swana.
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Yes.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
What is this, Swana?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Has done what?
She's gone, Leon.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Hello, Leon darling!
Hello.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
Now, please, Swana.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chÃ”teau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
Good morning.
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
We have nothing to discuss.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... I am delighted to have you here? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
I must ask you to leave.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Madame, if you...
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
I must insist that you leave.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
In that case I can only say good-by.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
I told you to go, madame.
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Unfortunately.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
Go on.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
What do you want?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Yes, it does.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Yes.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
May I ask why?
Please... sit down.
Cigarette?
Thank you.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
No.
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
May I ask what has happened?
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every cafÃš and night club. Here...  How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Yes... leaving immediately.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
I don't understand.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
I will do my best.
This will do.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
The future of the common people.
Where do you eat?
Where is it?
How do you do, my friend.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
My jewels?!
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
Could I have that in American?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
...I meant your food.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
Sheriff, I don't...
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of church bake sales in perspective...
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
...plenty
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Oww! My arm, careful!
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
No, Elden, I need to...
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
It wasn't a woman.
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
Jesus...
You think a woman did that?!
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Did you send anyone out there?
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Bad idea...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Yeah?
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Junior year!
Anyway, so what?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
A woman can write a check.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
Oww, the arm, the arm!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
You're lying!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
We think we know where Betty is.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Tell him what you told me.
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
I know that...
Well, do something, then, damnit!
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
That's a nice name for what you need...
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
What about it?
Any idea where it is?
Little place called Williams
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
I know plenty.
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
Banners?
No, I was just... How you doing?
Oh. How come?
They're fine... you miss it?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Who are these idiots?
Oh, this is wonderful...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know why I'm here?
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
...to see you.
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I am?
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Umm, I don't think that...
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
That's my son! My son is dead!
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
I better go check on them.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
I'd rather not...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
...what're you saying?
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
I don't think I am.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Yes, ma'am.
Umm... yes. Back home.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
No... what about your sister?
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
It's all right.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
The LeSabre!
Maroon.  I stole it.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Yeah, me too.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
I gotta go make dinner.
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Well, you are.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
What are you talking about?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I gotta go.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
No, Del.
You knew Del?!
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Lyla's very nice.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
You told me that two hours ago.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at Skies
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
I know. It's up to us.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Ad lib?
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
David, please --
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
So, call me when you --
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
I ran back in to get the phone.
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
What's so special about it?
What was that?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
Sure you don't want any salad?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
...like the water purifiers?
What?
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
I got you, Del...
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
They're new to us...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
I came for love...
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Uh-huh.
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Yes.
It was Chloe...
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
It's not really a good time, guys...
What's the matter here?
I begged him to let me put that on!
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
So you're into Reason
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
I'd slap his face.
Where you headed, Betty?
Los Angeles, California.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Did you love it?
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
That's horrible!
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
I left my husband two days ago.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
No. Loma Vista.
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
How did you know?
What's his real name?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
I'll go to the Hospital.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Like Rome?
Worse.
You made out alright.
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
I married a car salesman.
She called you 'George,' George.
...did I win some contest?
What are you doing?
He has no heartbeat!
You're hurting him!!
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
You don't sound like you're from here.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I came for love. My fiancÃš is here.
It's something I had to do. For David.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Man, that is love.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
I got this apartment with a guy.
The one you were telling me about?
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
The Five?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
He has a wife?!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  Please call if you have any information on David Ravell. This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
How many men have I talked to?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Guess who I saw today.
Doctor David Ravell.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
HE IS REAL!!
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Fine.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
...okay.
What are those for?
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Umm...
You never know who you'll see.
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You still in love?
He is real.
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
No, almost never.
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
Are you sure I can borrow this?
Rosa...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
You should have a little faith in people.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
All the time. It's always Loma Vista this, Loma Vista that.
Rosa, so you've met David?
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
What are you doing?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Your husband?!
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
No, that should be more than --
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
Ahh... my wife's.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
If we're for real?
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
Fine. You got five...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
What do you mean?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
Could you give us an example?
Of what?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
No...
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Hmmmm. Five Stars
You did not just say Injuns
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Like what?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
I... I don't know...
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
My socks?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
...and put them in your mouth.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Beer, please.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
That's right.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Now, that's really stupid.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Hell of a way to die.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
A mark, huh?
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
IT SURE IS!!
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
You told me how to do it!
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
He told us it's in the Buick.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
It's not here. Let's go.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
...that's a good motto.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
We can live with that.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Should I kill him now?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
What the hell was that, another statement?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
I hope you're right...
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Joyce was screwing Del.
...among others.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Like... us?
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
You're always so coarse... Do her right here. Let's just see what happens, okay?  I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother'
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
What?
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That make a statement
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
I know that.
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
Worse... you're in Texas.
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
What the hell's the matter with you?
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
How'd they describe her?
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
We should go.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
No.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral...  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
Where? Where is she?
What?
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
Wesley...
It's beneath her... She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
A doctor on the show... why?
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
I said 'got it?'
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
You made your point...  I was wrong.
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
What's wrong with you?
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
...and how long did she work here?
But she wanted more out of life, right?
I see.  May I?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
What'd you get her?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
Isn't that the point?
Seems like a nice place.
It is, if you like idiots...
You better believe it.
Jesus Christ!
He's waiting...
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Injuns?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, Betty?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
We know that...
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I don't know, George...
I'll think about it.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch? Remember?
What the hell's going on?
Is there a problem, George?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
I SAID FORGET IT!
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Oh fuck...
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
Would you say she was ambitious?
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
David Ravell.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Did Chloe crack?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
She's a lesbian.
You lie, motherfucker...
I swear to God!
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Her show?
A Reason to Love.
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Yeah?
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Waitaminute -
You can't do this -
Hang on there -
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
It ain't the law!
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
Gopher, Everett?
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
You mis'able little sneak thief...
That's right!
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
...Pete?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Huh?!
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
What do we do now, Everett?
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
Gopher, Everett?
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Four hundred, Delmar.
Izzat right?
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Where's Tommy?
Yeah, look at me.
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Whuhh...
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Uh, we uh-
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Pete have a brother?
Not that I'm aware.
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Okay, Everett.
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Oh my God!
'N turned into a frog -
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
Everett, my beard itches.
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Oh, okay.
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
A miracle! It was a miracle!
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
That ain't it!
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
Where's your ring, honey?
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
It's just a symbol, honey -
No weddin'.
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
That's right, honey.
But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's good, honey.
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
That's not my ring.
Not your...
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
You said -
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
You -
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Yes, but honey -
I counted to three, honey.
Well sure, honey, but...
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
Don't I know it.
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
It was in his bureau.
Who was fixing to betray us!
You didn't know that at the time!
That don't make no sense!
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
Pete, don't be ignorant-
The preacher said it absolved us.
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
A million dollars.
Million point two.
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
Well that hardly sounds like you...
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Wow
Let's go.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
It was a moment a weakness!
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Aw, that's all right.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Well, but Pete...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
But... but...
But...
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
Pete... I do apologize.
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
Who's the honcho around here?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write.
Yes - Sing Sing.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Yes - isn't it.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Goodbye, StewÃ¹
I think I better go, Stew.
I don't mind her if you don't.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
No? Why not?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
May I use your telephone?
You're all right.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romanceÃ¹
Just listen to thisÃ¹  Adorable BabykinsÃ¹ Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonelyÃ¹!
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
No - give you another guess.
So, it's obvious, huh?
Sure, I'll take a chance.
For what?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with meÃ¹
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
A littleÃ¹? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Now let's get this settledÃ¹
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not liveÃ¹
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear gartersÃ¹
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Gallagher?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
I'm not going!
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
Anne, come here. ListenÃ¹
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselvesÃ¹
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But IÃ¹
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
What's the idea, Anne?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
O-o-oh, I get youÃ¹  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
Ã¹and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that JaneÃ¹  Ã¹goes out and counts the silverware.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say Mr. Stew Smith and you'll have to be Mrs. Stew Smith or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husbandÃ¹He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  Ã¹and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
You're the Tribune man?
Fine. Have a seat.
Yale '21, I believe.
We were classmates.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
As one Tribune man to anotherÃ¹
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Thank you very much.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
I'm afraid.
Impossible. Put it on again.
What do you want?
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
How's that?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
Yeah?
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Look, I quit!
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
With me you can always do business.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Gloria Golden?
Yeah, little Gloria.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.
Well - it's only April.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense accountÃ¹
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Not on my own beat, no.
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Why not?
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Yes, sir.
Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
Well, when are you quitting?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Is that so?
That's so.
I hope so.
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
A what?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
What play?
My play.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Sure.
Araby, my eyeÃ¹!
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooeyÃ¹  Let me know when you're quitting.
No?
No!
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to seeÃ¹'  Tweet, tweet - ha, haÃ¹
How do you like your bath, sir?
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Who are you?
You're my what?
Your valet, sir.
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Drunk, sir?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Thank you, sir.
But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Quite so. Quite.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Now Mr. Smith, now pleaseÃ¹
All right, outside!
I beg your pardon, sir?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
That's a canary, sir.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes sir!
Yes.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Yes.
I bet.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
The boss is getting hoarse.
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
You what?
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's itÃ¹
Ã¹and thatÃ¹
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Well!
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
I didn't run away.
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Thanks, thanks.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
It's the smoke.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Not since you broke into society.
Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
My error.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Sure - I think so, Stew.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
There you areÃ¹!
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Nothing.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
I dyed one and washed the other.
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Staring at us?
My mistake - she's glaring.
Must be my wife.
Right!
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Yes.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Okay.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
Yes - and I'd love it.
How far have you gotten?
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Been where?
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Did who?
Conrad.
What do you know about Conrad?
Right.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Right.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Very good.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Yeah?
Sorry, bossÃ¹
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Who was that?
What did he want?
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
What other girlÃ¹?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
No.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
A statement? Good.
I have it here.
Good.
I think you'd better go.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, andÃ¹
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
You quit trying to stop anybodyÃ¹
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Traps shut!
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
I suppose you know why I cameÃ¹?
Now don't be absurd, SmithÃ¹  May I come in?
I don't eat waffles.
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
She didÃ¹?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
That's putting it crudely, butÃ¹
I beg your pardon.
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
We just thought thatÃ¹
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
Yes.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
With pleasure, Madame!
Nobody seems to want to do anythingÃ¹  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
Good morning, everybodyÃ¹  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a SmytheÃ¹
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
Now the lady said you may goÃ¹
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
You try it.
Found no skeletons?
It's haunted just the same.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
A bird in a gilded cage?
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Thanks.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
Mary Sue?
Sure.
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
What do you mean?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
Yeah ...  That--and ...
What?
Ah.
You sure you want to know this?
Yes.
Okay.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
What?
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
We're in Pleasantville?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
It can't be possible.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
Oh no ... I'm fine.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
I'm fine.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
Have you got any make up?
In my handbag.
Does it look okay?
Looks just like it did.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Wait.
What?
Thank you.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I won't.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
... It's a pretty short trip.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
I love you too.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
I think it looks nice.
Where'd you get this?
Bud?
She's crying.
She's crying.
Yes she is.
I've got to go ...
No ...
What is that?
But I really should get home.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Like a drum.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
I told you where I was.
All night?
I was in a bowling-alley.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
Sure you are.
No I'm not.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
I don't want to put on some make up ...
It goes away ... It'll go away.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
Where are you gonna go?
I'm gonna go now.
Um ... It's ...
Well gee whizz Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Oh, gosh no.
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
You want to get out of here?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
Oh, Biff. You can pin me any time you want to.
... Why?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Trust me ...
What are you doing?
So.
Oh.  I can't.
I'm busy.
Don't! Just let go.
I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
I don't believe it.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little different lately ...
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
What'll it be?
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
Want some bridge mix?
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain changes going on in the town.  You know what I mean by changes?
No. What?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
One of those ... big beds?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
Thank you very much.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
No. Of course not.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Are you alright?  What is it?
Rain.
Real rain?
What happened?
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said Honey. I'm home.
Yes I did.
Do you know that it's illegal?
Yes I do.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Still doesn't make it right.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
We prefer to keep these proceedings as pleasant as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
Well--it was dark out ...
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
I think I've got something to say.
Very well ...
It's like the basketball team.
The basketball team?
See, I know you want it to stay Pleasant but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
Okay--that's enough!
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
You're not allowed to lie.
Why am I out of order?
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
It's not in ME.
Oh sure it is.
Dan! Arrest them!
What do you mean!?
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
What?
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
I thought the books were blank?
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Mr. Simpson ...
No, not that hedge. The other one.
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Pleasantville Marathon?
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
Lemme see that.
No way.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
God, David. Just give it to me!
What happened?
I'm not sure.
What did you do?
I don't know.
Noooooo!
You--you gotta get us out of here.
I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
I don't believe this.
Neither do I.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Just take deep breaths.
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
We're supposed to be in school.
Owns the hardware store.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
To who?
Who's that?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Does he--you know--like me?
As a matter of fact he does.
Hunh.
Those are my friends.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
I don't think so.
No way.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
What were you doing in a library?
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
JENNIFER!
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
Jen, listen ...
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
I could like kill a guy with these things.
It's in your closet.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
He won't notice anyway.
What do you mean?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
So what's the point?
Jen please ...
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
Gee whiz Bud, what could we possibly need when we have each other?
What did you do to him?
Nothing.
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
You have no right to do this.
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be attractive. They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
Me too. Sounds swell.
Really? It seems so fattening.
Not directly anyhow ...
It's fine.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
Sure.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
The pages filled in?
Nothing.
Nothing?
You're reading?
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
... Yeah.
That's great.
So what is it?
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
No. She really liked you.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Wow.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
How come I'm still in black and white?
What?
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
What?
Are you sure?
I told you. I'm like positive.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
You got the admissions letter.
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
That was sure swell ...
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
Keeps going ...
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Hi.
Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
Sure ... Where would we go?
... Lover's Lane?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Mmmmgh.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
What?
Out there.
How?
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Yeah.
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
You want some berries?
Hunh?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
They just grow like that?
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
What's going on?
Rain.
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
What do we do?
We'll just put up the top.
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
It was a prop for the school play ...
Can I open it?
Sure ...
Where are they?
I'm not sure.
No I won't. I swear.
I like calling you David.
I like it too.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
Marmalade.
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
... Like Prince Charming.
Yeah ...
McIntire's.
Ooomph?
How much does it cost?
What the hell's going on!
Because we don't belong!
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Don't get upset.
Where are you going ...
WAIT A MINUTE!!
COME BACK!!!
I can't.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my dad I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Re-runs?
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just cookies after all ...
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Oh--well ...
What do you mean?
Look--it just sort of happened ...
I had nothing to do with that.
Look ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why?
No you're not.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
I'm going to leave now.
Why?
Why don't you just take me back without it?
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
There's worse places.
What's wrong?
Yeah ...
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
I understand.
What?
Listen to me!
Do you have the lettuce?
Have you cooked the burgers?
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Oh hi!
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
Yeah ...
Yeah ...
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Just listen to me ...
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
... What's that?
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Yeah.
Hi.
I brought you something ... From the library.
It's an art book.
What's wrong?
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
TV repair?
Yeah ...
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Free?
What happened?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Oh GOD ...
Yeah ... Saw you too.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Ok, bye-bye.
...yes I'm still on hold...
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Ok. Thank you.
Somewhere in Utah.
D&D Mattress Man.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
That's your fault not mine.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
So it's ok if I bring her.
Please don't.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I'm trying to be your friend.
I know.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
Hello everyone.
Did I say that?
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
No.
You look nervous.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I don't know.
Yeah I can't.
Why?
I have work, I can't leave.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna call you back.
It's fine, but --
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I feel really on the spot now.
Are you gonna do it?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
What?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
Yeah I can't.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
What's all this pudding?
It's not mine.
Why's it here?
I have no idea.
Call me later.
Hey. What are you doing?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
You're so scared.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
I just want to know where she's staying.
Tell me why.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
-- what are you talking about, come on --
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
Hello, this is Back.
Yes.
Hi. This is Jack.
Nothing.
No.
Where are you?
No.
Sure.
...just talking to you....
No.
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
Really?
It doesn't matter.
No.
She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
...yeah.....
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
No.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
Hello?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Hi....what....what's up....?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
I'm going to work.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Me?
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
I know but I....how much is it?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
No. I'm sorry.
....what....?
Hello?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I don't have a girlfriend --
I know I did. But I don't.
I didn't lie.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
This is not cool.
I have to go.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
No.
They're not open yet?
They don't get opened until eight.
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
I don't know.
Do you know them.
Not very well.
I think that'll be fine.
There's a piano in the street.
Thank you.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Ok.
Hi.
Hi.
Yes I do.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
No. Not at all. It's nice.
Business is good, you're busy?
I saw a picture of you.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
What do you do with all this pudding?
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
Are you guys hurt?
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
Really?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- well, if you're gonna go --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Sure.
This is funny.
Yeah.
Ok.
Alright?
....Hi.....
....Hi.....
Who is it?
It's Barry.
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
Yeah.
How long have you known her?
About six months.
You like her?
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
No, no. I did.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Yeah.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.7
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
....yeah....
So that was your pudding?
....No....
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
Is everything ok?
Yes.
What happened?
What did he want?
Nothing.
There's a better place for us to eat.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Did you pick it up from the street?
What?
...yes I did...?
Yes? I'm trying.
Oh that's great.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
...yeah...
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
I don't know.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
Ok. Have a good trip.
This is Barry.
Hi.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Really?
Yeah.
So what do I do then?
That was good.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Ok.
I don't freak out very often.
What do you mean?
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
...I don't know what you mean....
I don't freak out.
Ok.
Hello?
Lena?
Yeah?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Yes.
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
About six months ago. Why?
I just wanted to make sure.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Where you married?
yeah.
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
Yeah......yeah.....
It's so nice.
This really looks like Hawaii here.
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
This is funny.
Yeah.
This is nice.
Where do you have to go?
For what?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
How many times have you been on an airplane?
I think maybe over a hundred.
That's right you travel so much.
I forgot about that.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Yeah.
It's ok to ask that.
I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
You left me at the hospital.
You can't do that.
Ok.
So here we go.
It's a plastic, yeah.
Did you have my home phone number?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Bye.
Just have you for one second, please.
Yeah.
Did you do it?
No.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
No.
Well who did?
You're hand is bleeding.
How?
On my knife.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I didn't do that.
Your hand is bleeding.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Why?
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
I didn't do it.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Please don't do this to me.
The police are on their way.
Sorry.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
Hello, how are you?
Yes it is.
Can I ask how much is this?
......and this is confidential?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
What's that for?
And this is confidential?
337.....I'm sorry....
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
What?
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
Yes I did.
Can we agree that that is that?
Thank you.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
Sorry about that.
....I have seven.
Hi Walter.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
That was weird. I meant good.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
And I'm sorry that I did that.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Fine, thank you.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
Hey, good morning, Barry.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
You ok?
Yes I'm fine.
Why you wearin' a suit?
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
....yes.....
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
Good morning, Barry....
Hi, Lance.
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
You're goin' on a trip?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
You should go on a trip.
No thanks.
Let's just leave it there for now.
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
WHICH?
...I'll tell you later.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
What's up?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
What happened?
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Where you goin?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Ok.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Ok.
That's funny.
Yeah.
Let's just figure that out later --  Ok. I gotta go. I'm just gonna go now and I'll call you from there, you're in charge 'till I get back. And don't tell my sisters anything? He exits.
Where you been?
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
Hey.
I need to talk to you for a second.
What?
You gotta give me some money.
Wait a minute --
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Please don't do this.
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
What do you have in the house?
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
You have an ATM?
Yes.
Is this where you live?
Yes.
You have another house somewhere or something?
No.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Alright, alright.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
I'm sorry.
Yes. Sorry.
I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
This is Barry.
What are you doing?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What time are you gonna be there?
Seven o'clock.
I won't.
I'm serious.
I know.
Ok.
You can't be late though.
I know.
I know.
Seriously.
I know.
You can't just stay in your house.
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
I won't.
I don't really remember that.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
Yes, yes, right.
That's cool.
As soon as you want.
I thought Latisha said you would --
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Ok.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
It's fine.
It's ok. That's alright.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
I'll go pay for my car.
Yeah.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
It's not bad, it's ok.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Sorry.
We should be going --
You ready?
Are you coming to eat with us?
Are you ready?
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Ok.
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
Just tell him to call me.
Ok.
So...did my brother call you?
No.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
It's fine.
He did seem a little strange.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Should I call you later?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Ok.
They do not!
Are you okay?
That's always tough. How long were you together?
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
I found a picture of his wife.
I think he wants me.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Really? That's amazing.
Psychology.
Help!
Oh my God! We're dead!
Hey, I have an idea...
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
Hey, you left your book back there.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
No. I never date outside my race.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Maybe we can study together or something.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Hi Buddy.
Open chest!!!
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Okay.
Buddy...
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Shhh!
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Alright!
Where the hell are we?
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Hugh Kane.
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Yes...
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
I was thinking the same thing.
Great!!!
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Huh?
What about you, Buddy?
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
He's here.
Shit!
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Can you feel that?
No. Try a little higher.
Feel that?
No. Keep rubbing.
Better try a little higher.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Cindy, let me...
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
There's something I really want to share with you.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
Oh.
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Hey, look out, a bee!
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
What should we get?
I don't care. You pick.
Hot dogs.
I think so.
What, you think I did this to myself?
Okay, I get the point.
But he'll kill her!
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Oh, right.
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
How about these buns?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Right behind you.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
I'm Cindy.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Hanson, please.
Stop touching his brain!
Stop! --
It was you...
This can't be happening?
I don't need your help.
What the hell are you doing?
Just wait, you'll see.
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
What are we gonna do?
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
I'll go.
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
Alright, let's take a vote...
Father!
Yes, we made it!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
No, my friends are right here!
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
You could use the grade, huh?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Oh.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Am I cool now?
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Aww, the little bird died.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Hey, I got an idea.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Did you do that?
Uh, uh.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Are you?
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
Got my camera right here.
I got it!
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Theo, did you see the animal?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
What are you getting at, Professor?
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Got a problem with that?
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I wouldn't go that far.
I don't like this, this...
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Who?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Saw who?!
Don't touch me!!
I finished all the interviews.
Let me see the files.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
Let me help you.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Here you go, Professor.
Are these all the subjects?
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Any of them hot?
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
What's this?
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
In about fifteen minutes.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Right. What about condoms?
Professor!
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Would you please focus?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Even in the bathroom?
That one.
After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
Professor, I think you should see this.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
The image there.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
What the hell?!
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
What is it, Dwight?
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
What?
That's why we came here, remember?
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
I can do it myself.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
The keys. She took the keys.
Hi.
Just a little experiment.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
And sexy.
Just a little Rogaine.
That's right.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Thanks, handyman.
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Okay, give me my belt.
I guess so.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
I certainly did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
FUCK YOU!
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Who is this?
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
Alright, I'll try...  Cocksucker. That's what she calls me.
GODDAMN YOU!
What did you just say?
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
No, I don't.
I certainly was not!
One beer with lunch is hardly drinking.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Did you see her?! She just said Fuck you to me!
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Did you change your hair?
You might wanna think about it
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Everything's free there.
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
McKinley?...McKinley?
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Are you spoken for this evening?
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
Care to indulge?
Indulge?
In a little masquerade?
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Shove it, Ralph!
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
So what's up?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I love you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
And?
Huh.
Yeah, I'm here.
So I guess that's it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
What are you pouring tonight?
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Highliner.
Say, is Maya working?
They're from both of us.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
Is it chicken?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Nice.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Me too.
Hi.
I can explain.
Hiya.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Highliner, please.
That's on us.
Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Anything I'd know?
Maybe. Recognize this?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
I am one of those guys.
You are not.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
No, we're paying for the wine.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Well, in that case...
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
I can't help the traffic.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Yeah.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
Oh, that's tasty.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Just tell me.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Sure is tasty.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Oh yeah. Much better.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
What?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
How old's she going to be?
Um... seventy... something.
That's a good age.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
That's your problem, Miles.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
I'd rather have a knife.
I'm working on it.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
And get your bone smooched.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
I told you. Filet and salmon.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Let me call Christine.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
I owe her a call anyway.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Now we're talking.
This is rose, right?
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
What color is it supposed to be?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Huh.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
What do you smell?
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
That's what you do with every one.
When do we get to drink it?
Now.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Are you chewing gum?
Want some?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Whoa.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
So you're going to stop acting?
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
If that's what feels right.
It does. Feels right.
Yeah. Tight.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
She is very hot.
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
And she likes Pinot.
Perfect.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
She works for tips!
You're blind, dude. Blind.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
How do you know?
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Shut up.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The rancher's special breakfast? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
So what's the plan today?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Nice, huh?
Beautiful.
Miles.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
She what?  When?
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
What do you think?
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
I'm a quick learner.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Get the trunk.
You have the keys.
We're on.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
With Maya?
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Well, she is cute.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Nah. I want to watch this.
So what should I wear?
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Aye-aye, captain.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Okay! Fuck!
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Bathroom.
Did you drink and dial?
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
We were supposed to play golf.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Count me out.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
Later.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah. Okay.
You should call her.
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
Okay! Jesus!
What'd Christine say?
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Yep.
What're you drinking?
Where is Stephanie?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
With this chick.
Does she know about Saturday?
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
Deep.
Understanding of what?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Yeah.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nope.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Can you give me some room here?
Oh yeah. Sure.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Thanks, Jack.
You're an asshole.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up.
Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
What is it?
Fucker hit into us.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
I don't want to talk about it.
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
Is it the money thing?
Is what the money thing?
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
We're on.
What's happening?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
I said okay?
You have to tell me --
I SAID OKAY?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
No.
What?
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Let's leave it alone.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
I know what you need.
Do you like them?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Are they too sporty?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I don't have to.
I say we check it out. You never know.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
What's that supposed to mean?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Thanks.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Keep it elevated.
Well?
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
That's thoughtful.
Yeah.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
Huh. Let me think.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
You know what I'm thinking?
What's that?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
Uh-huh.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
What?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
We gotta go back.
What?
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
No way. No way.
Please, Miles, please.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
She tell you she was married?
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
The plan is... you go.
Me?
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hold on.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Hrnrnrn?
That was quite a day yesterday.
Quite a week.
No, I'm okay.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
Come on, let me drive.
I'm fine. You rest.
I feel like driving.
What the fuck!
You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!
I'll pay for it.
Look at this!
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
You broke some.
Whatever. Sorry.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Well. That about does it.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Yeah.
Back at you.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Maya, how are you?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
You want to join us?
Sure.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Good for you.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
The Windmill.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
What are you drinking?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Try it.
Nice. Very nice.
Twelve months in oak.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I know. I love that.
I'm having the salmon.
That's what I'm having.
Are you all right?
She got anything good?
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
So what gems do you have in your collection?
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
Yeah, I know.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
How long have you been into wine?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
What was the bottle that did it?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah, same here.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Yeah. Definitely.
So what's your novel about?
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
What's the title?
The Day After Yesterday.
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Yeah. Thanks.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Well...
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Yeah? Like what?
Like what a fraud he was.
Bathroom over there?
Yeah.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Got it.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Good. So did I.
Okay. See you around.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
Goodnight, Miles.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
You too.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Okay.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
What rehearsal dinner?
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Maya.
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
I'm sure he believed every word.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
Yeah.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Hello?
Victoria.
Miles?
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
Where are you?
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Hello?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Ken.
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
That was big of him.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
That's great.
So what's happening with your book?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
I guess.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
See you over there, Miles.
How much skin and stem contact?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
French or American?
Good stuff.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
I told you I need a drink.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Exactement!
Should we get dessert?
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
He had to make a phone call.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
You golf?
Where?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
You talked to Wendy?
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
How'd he know I'd come?
Meaning?
What are you talking about?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Superstition.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Tramp.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Bitch.
Let me guess. We're going on a long trip.
Someone actually... employs you?
Which street corner?
Hi.
...You any good with those?
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
The band.
Not lately.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Looks like the alternator.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Dammit, Carl!!!!
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Come on --
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Gene.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
You know who I am. You invited me.
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
How... was she called?
Pardon?
Aunt Edith. How did she... die?
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
I'll be fine here.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
She was talking about... a harvest of blood...
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Blood?
You'll be back.
I don't think so.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little talk about grandaddy Jethro.
Sure. What do you want to know.
People say he was a murderer.
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? Crazy Old Macdonald! But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
-- It's not me!
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
It's time to make amends.
Amends...?
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
The audience!
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Down boy.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
He's right. You were behind.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
How does it feel, Keith?
Time for a little... feedback guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Yeah?
picked Tonight to come by And watch our set.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Nothing to tell.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
About what?
Name something.
Then why go back now?
Still trying to figure it out myself.
What about Jeremiah?
Nah. Just you.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
So?
Let it go.
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... Jethro.
I said that's enough!
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Getting ready.
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Mmmm -- so can I...
You wouldn't understand.
You never had trouble communicating before.
Suzie --
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
Wait a minute --
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
What are --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
-- You're not making sense!! What Scarecrow?
You're... limping.
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
Suzie... No.
It's you. You and your father.
No --
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Listen to me --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Suzie --
No Mac, please... I --
Don't look.
Mac... let's get out of here.
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
I almost thought for a second...
Never.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Spider.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
Second verse!
Where have you two been?
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
What'll we do?
Shit.
'Mornin', Jack.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
What?
And that makes you look like a squid?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
That's not funny.
Sorry.
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
What you up to?
Just checking out the lights.
Pretty, ain't they?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Oh, yeah?
Grant, where'd you go?
Hey, Grant.
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
No. WhatÃ ?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
How about Brenda?
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
He tried to kill you, Starla.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
Starla, it ain't --
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
No reception out here.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
That wasn't a good night, no.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
What are you doing?!
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
No, Starla! No!
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
Yeah. Good.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Aspirin.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Okay.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
It's my nature.
And this is mine.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
Where are you?!
Shelby!
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Are you nodding?
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
Do it.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Who's the lucky fella?
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Joey.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
It's just a work thing.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Sure you do.
Flip.
Where are you going?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Out.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
You're my princess, aren't you?
Okay.
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
What are you doing?
Who's that?
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
I'll get if for you.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Grant, no!
I loved you. I loved --
Grant, you're sick!
What other stuff?
Through a wound on his stomach?
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
Your what?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
If...?
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
You know how rumors start.
Last year, this was a new rig.
How much style?
What do you think?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
A what?
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Having fun.
They're both a challenge.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Would I lie to you?
I give up.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Anything?
Shoot.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Well?
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Hey...
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
See ya, Kate.
You know this guy, don't you?
By stealing my car?
You could've asked.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
Mississippi's the other way!
Let's hit it.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
Kate...
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
And?
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
Bandit II?
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Weight Station.
What can I say?
That man is your father?!?
Absolutely.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
I'm begging.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
That's me.
Another time.
No.
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
How'd you know?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Or in the slammer.
Waynette!
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
No.
See.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
How long's this gonna take?
I don't know, man. Ask him?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Also boring.
But I still don't think...
What are you doin' now?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Yeah?
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
He's history.
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
Shit! No one's here.
Liquid gold.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Can a pig whistle?
Hit the brakes!
They're jammed!
Let's get the hell outta here.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
We still on schedule?
Forty-two minutes ahead.
I hate to say I told you so.
Save it. We got a long haul.
Clear and rolling.
Bandit I, do you copy?
This is Bandit I, come back.
You can't swear on these.
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
What's your twenty?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Not for long, you ain't.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
What does the old Timex say?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
Yeah, guy?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
What's your twenty?
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
Gimme a twenty; pardner.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
I ran into complications.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
We're gone.
Bandit?
Never mind. It's nothing.
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
Now what?
We're outta motion lotion.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
I'll believe it when I see it.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
We'll be waiting. Over.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
You okay?
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
how we doing?
Talk to me.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Let's boogie.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Bandit II?
You're coming up to the scale house.
I'm cucumber cool.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
What's that, pardner?
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Yeah, but...
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
Go breaker.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Pick it up, Breaker.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
About one to five years worth.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Where the hell are you?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Yes, ma'am.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
I do not understand the final question...
The question is irrelevant.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
I would accept that as an axiom.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Yeah.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Why don't I?
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
A moment alone, please.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
I just wish we could cloak the stench.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
I mean him, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
It'll come back to him.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Bones --
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
Bones, stay here.
Now wait just a damn minute.
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
We've done it before.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
Would you prefer to do nothing?
-- That's the general idea.
That's crazy!
It doesn't look all that different.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Oh, joy.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
What do you think, Spock?
What did you say she was getting?
Cramps.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Wake up, man, wake up!
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You're joking...!
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
I liked him better before he died.
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
... My God...
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
That is what I said, Doctor.
Then how.?
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... Best shot...?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
Guessing is not in my nature...
Well nobody's perfect...
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your guesses than most other peoples facts.
We're just -- observing.
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
No choice now, Scotty!
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Understood. What is your plan?
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
I suppose they told you that...?
The hell they did.
So you were at Berkeley.
I was not.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
You sure you won't change your mind?
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
You mean man...
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Why's that?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
How soon?
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
Back to San Francisco.
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
You've already been that. C'mon.
Thanks.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Memory problems, too.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Iowa.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Can I ask you something?
What's going to happen when you release the whales?
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
Then --
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
It's his way.
Do you trust me?
Implicitly.
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
Thanks. Cheers.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
Where could you take them?
Hm?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What do you mean now?
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
What's that?
What's what?
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
Wanna try it from the top?
... Who are you?
Who do you think I am?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
All right. The truth?
I'm all ears.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Noon tomorrow...?!
Well, Admiral
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
So. There we are.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Right.
It's true... what you said...
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Steady, now. We need your help.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
But Kirk...
Kirk. They're gone.
... Gone?!
... Damn!
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
A spaceship with a missing man.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The frequency.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
You need me.
... What does that mean?
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
... You have a point...
Hey! -- Where you going?!
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Don't worry. I'll find you.  See you around the galaxy...
Permission to come aboard.
Thank you, Admiral.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
Where are you going?!
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Spock...?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Whales?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Mr. Spock, your computations?
In progress, Admiral.
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
You've programmed that from memory...?
I have.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Well done, Mr. Spock.
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Explain.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
How do you know this...?
... Simple logic.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Yes.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: Double dumb ass on you -- and so forth...
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Ah... The giants.
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Yes?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I see.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
Exaggerate.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
How will playing cards help?
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
Status?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Our mission! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about that!!
Thank you, Spock.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Right.  Will you help us?
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a guess.
You?  Spock, that's extraordinary.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Spock: Condition report!
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
I will, Admiral.
Weapons systems?
Steady as she goes...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
What is our condition?
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Picture, Uhura!
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Systems report.  Communications?
Mr. Sulu?
What is it?
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
On speakers.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Everyone remember where we parked.
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
Uhura!... Where!
Bearing!
On screen.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
Scotty, how long is this bay?
About 60 feet, Admiral.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Humpbacked - people.?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Two?
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Mr. Sulu?
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Admiral! There be whales here!
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Full power, sir.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
On my way...!
The whales...?!
No power to the bay doors.
The explosive override -- ?
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
You will be in good hands here.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
Well, that's different.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer you.
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Hello? Computer...?
The keyboard... How quaint.
That's the ticket, laddie.
Father...?
Most kind, Father.
They are my friends.
Tell her I feel fine...
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Shit.
I know, I know.
You're right. I know.
I don't know about that.
It didn't feel that way.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
No. Stop, come on.
Shuddup.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
How are you ladies doing this evening?
Oh... a Cavalier.
Thanks.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Yeah.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Well, thank you...?
Hi.
Like the quiche?
I like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Not lately.
Just like that?
Tell me about it...
Yeah.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
It does.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
What what? What advantages?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Charles! What's up, man?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
...not until you book it...
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
My pleasure.
I haven't heard an official no yet.
I'm considering taking a job as a Goofy.
...Four days..?
...I mean, does it have to be Goofy? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
Could you believe it?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
I'm a comedian.
Sorry?
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Sure, that'll be fine.
Do you have anything smaller?
No...
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Why not?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Six years.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Sorry, it's just that...
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
I would love to see you again sometime.
I'll be around.
You're a comedian?
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from You Bet Your Life, right?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...It's really getting late.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...Which one...?
...The red piece of shit over there...
...well, it suits you...
Hello?
Hi, Mike?
Are you on the other line?
Yeah, hold on.
I can call back...
No, no. Hold on.
Hi. Sorry about that.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at The Room. Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
...Six months.
Fine... I guess. You?
Yeah?
What kind of things?
Really?
Why didn't you call?
...the Michelin commercial...
Hi.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
Right.
So I don't call either way.
Right.
So what's the difference?
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right.
Well that sucks.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
There's the rub.
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Hey man, don't sweat it.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
It's a gig.
I mean, I need the money.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
There's just something about being Goofy. Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
It's like Hi
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
I didn't want to say anything.
Why?
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Kinda.
Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
I do. Good for you, man.
I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead. Play it out.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
How many strokes?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I'll give you an eight.
What'd you get?
An eight.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
Oh.  Where is this place?
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Sounds more like Aids...
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Kinda money, huh?
Classy.
Bud.
...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Darwinism at its best.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
There's the rub.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
I just tested for one...
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Him?
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
There are so many beautiful women here.
It's unbelievable.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Go for it, man.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
I'll be your winger.
Thanks, man.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
You haven't been drinking, have you?
No. Just O.J.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
You want to talk about it?
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
I'm such an asshole.
She wasn't your type anyway.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
Well, you're doing so well...
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
I didn't make it...
That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are money.
Then why won't she call...?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
You always know the right thing to say.
You little bitch!
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
Make someone bleed.
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
Pause it.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
So, what? Eleven?
What's he do?
He's trying to be an actor.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
...He's derivative...
Who threw this party, anyway?
Damned if I know...
Not well.
Rejected?
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
I can't believe you.
She was cute.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
You asshole.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
...People get carjacked...
You live in such a fantasy world...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
What are they doing here?
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
She's really special, guys.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is...
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all...
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says Breakfast Any Time, right?
I'll have pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Hello?
S'up Trent?
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I don't know...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I don't know...
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
When?
You're crazy.
I'm not going to Vegas.
Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Wait.
What?
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
Vegas.
Wake up, baby.
Whu?
You seem surprised to see me.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
You may.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Behave!
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
Cut that shit out.
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
That's where we make our scene.
You think they're watching?
Double down.
What?!?
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
I know, but...
You gotta do it.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Always, baby.
Always.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's just leave.
Who's the big winner?
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
She smiled, baby.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
Baby, did you hear her? You shouldn't leave without getting something for free. She wants to party, baby.
You think so?
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
She likes you.
I don't know...
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
That's bullshit.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
...gotta...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
I know. I know.
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
Come in.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Baby, you did fine.
...Baby...
...It's just, I thought Renaissance was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Whatever.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
What was the part?
Big Brother, Little Brother?
Wait... Wait... Just Brother. So I go in. Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah... Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
No!
Yes!
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like Wait a second. They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
No! Not the camera guy!
I'm telling you!
...So give me the fuckin part...
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like How old is the Brother?. He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says Eleven.
What?
I gotta use the phone.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Hold on.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Sorry about interrupting...
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
Christy was nice...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
No, baby. You're money.
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I don't think so.
Yeah, a good friend.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
I just need some time...
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Don't remind me.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
...a day...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Selling scrap metal.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
He drives a carriage.
What?!?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're all that and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
I hear she's getting real fat.
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
No. Doesn't that suck?
May I wash you?
Groovy.
You guys are such assholes.
Aww... He got away?
What time's this party tonight?
Who? Rob?
Yeah. You met him once.
Yeah. He's a rounder.
...the Copa, in New York...
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
...It looked money.
It's on.
Which one?
What are you doing?
What?
You looked right at her, baby.
She didn't notice.
I'm sorry.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
Was I money?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
She didn't see.
That doesn't matter.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Care for some saki?
Sak-i it to me!
We got the digits, baby.
What a surprise.
What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
No, baby!
Tomorrow?
No...
So, two days?
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
What an asshole. Didn't you see Boys in the Hood? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
It's not like that...
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Bitch... You little bitch!
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Because he's a bitch.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
...against the computer.
They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
You could make their heads bleed, though.
Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
...Is he brown?
What a surprise...
...How novel.
Oh, it's on, baby...
...It's on.
Is she looking at me, baby?
No.
No.
Is she looking now?
See, baby?
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
That was pretty cold, dude.
You think?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...double diamond...
True.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
To my health.
Kiss me.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...we're not...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...shivering...
...And you're just looking at your claws like How do I kill this bunny?...
...You're just poking at it...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...and fangs... and you're like I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?...
...you're like a big bear.
...honestly...
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Now go over there and get those digits.
You're money.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
...Tomorrow, then a day.
...Yeah.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
You dick.
...Anaheim...
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...Oh yeah, like Cypress Hill was gonna do anything...
...Sue...
...Shut up, Sue...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Sue!
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Is it about my teeth?
Yes.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
It's on...
It's on.
...it's definitely on.
...it is so on.
Sorry man.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
...Definitely...
...Okay, two...
...just be smart about it.
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
Our little baby's growing up...
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Hey, how are you?
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Where am I?
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Thanks.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
She's working on another lead right now.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Thank you, Basil.
Yes?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
What's the other?
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
What?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Be careful.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Yes Basil?
Be careful!
Hey, Mick!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Good on ya, man.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Man, you are one chilly square!
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
My mother's told me all about you.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I beg your pardon?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
My wedding tackle.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Sure.
Do I make you horny?
What?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
I'm sure.
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Here, use mine.
I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Do you want to talk to him?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
A limousine has just pulled up.
Let me see.
How do you know?
I never forget a pussy... cat.
Let's go get him!
He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I don't get it.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I hate having my picture taken.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
Fancy a nibble?
I couldn't have another bite.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Go! Just go!
I haven't had fun like that since college.
I'm sorry.
Why?
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
I am not.
Oh, yes you are.
I can't. You're drunk.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
Really, Austin!
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Of course, luv.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Not in the Nineties.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Who?
You know who.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Does that make you horny?
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Indeed.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Yes.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Fair enough.
What do we do now?
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Austin, what's your point?
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
Likewise.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Don't worry!
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I'll secure the perimeter.
I have something to tell you.
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Kiss me.
Behave!
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
That's not mine.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Sure.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
Silence!
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
We've got a lot of work to do.
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Yes.
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
What is it now?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Right.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Not me.
An evil vet?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Yeah. What?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
I don't want to.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Blow me.
What did you say?
Show me.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Scott, don't say that...
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser.  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the Ozone Layer. Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Great.
He's asleep.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Just passing through Santa Carla?
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
I don't like horror comics.
This one could save your life.
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
I don't like horror comics.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
Why?
All day.
Can't stand light?
Wears sunglasses in the house.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Yeah.
He's a vampire alright.
Why not?
He's my brother.
You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
I'll have to drive!
We don't ride with vampires.
Fine!  Stay here!
Burn rubber does not mean warp speed!
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
They're gaining on us!
You gotta drive!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Time to activate Plan B.
What's Plan B?
What about his teeth?
I just don't see it.
Did you ever...
Should I run him through?
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
They're gonna book us.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Whattaya mean?
You know what?  You're absolutely right.
Maximum body-count.
We still going?
Honda 250, huh?
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
We were gonna grab some food.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
What?...
Why?  They're only noodles.
I'm my own man.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
What's going' on?
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
What is this, David?
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
Where you going?
With him?
Yeah.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
No.  Stick around.
Leave him alone.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
Look.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's dating one!
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From Vampires Everywhere...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a Guardian -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell -- are often employed for this purpose.'
How do you know they're not?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Well, it's kind of weird.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Chill out Edgar.
What's that smell!?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
Oh, no...
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Of course not!
I'll take you there.
I said, I'll take you there. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Sam, don't --
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the closet monster!
I told Max eight o'clock.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
You have a T.V.?
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Good!
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
I thought we were goin' into town.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
No, he's really evil.
This is Michael.
Who, Laddie?
Laddie... you can still remember. You can still remember home.
No, Laddie.  It was a memory.
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
I like Michael.
Still mad at me?
For what.
He looks dead.
He's just a deep sleeper.
He's not breathing, Mom.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Oh, no, you won't.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
I'll pass.
Michael, are you still in bed?
No.  I'm up.
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
Okay.
Sure.
We are...
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Mom... please.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Gotta go, Mom.
I didn't invite you in this time!
Get out, Mom!  Run!
We're getting close...
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
Tell them to get something to eat.
Not that poor.
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
Help me, Mom.  Help.
He met a girl.
Can we get a T.V.?
Lights out, Sam.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
He's already gone to bed.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
In here?
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
C'mere, Nanook.
Oh, no.  Now what?
Must be a circuit breaker.
What did you say?
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a mom!
Not funny, Sam!
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
But, Mom...
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
No, I'm not...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Ohmygod...
Mom!
What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
Lucy.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
a job.
Do I look that needy?
Say hello to Thorn.
Hi, Thorn.
You're cute, Max.
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Max!  What's wrong?
It's garlic!!  I like garlic, but...
I'm really sorry, Max.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
He doesn't walk all over me.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
I hope so.
Something the matter?
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
Max... what are you talking about?
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and yours.
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Does it burn?
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
I am?
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
But you passed the test!
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Did you want to talk to me?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Okay.  Talk.
I just wanted to... I, uh...
Hi...
What's your name?
Star.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
What do you mean?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I like Star.
Me, too.
I'm Michael.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
I guess you're new around here.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Okay.
Ouch.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Now you and David...
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Let's go see them.
No... no, everything's different now...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
When?
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Okay.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Why not?
Because I love you...
Then it's not too late for us...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
David's looking for me... I have to go.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
You've got to put this on.
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
They'll be coming for all of us.
It's gone.  I feel it!
So do I!
What!?  He can and I can't?!  No fair!!
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
This is kind of a cool place.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Will you give Mom a break?
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Even poor people have T.V.s
This room is mine.
I was here first.
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
You're beautiful.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Where are we going?
Nowhere.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Do I have to do this?
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Go away.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
What did you do last night?  You look wasted.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
What would that make Mom?
Did you spill something?
No.  Why?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.
Mom's home?...
No.  On the phone.
I'm making you a sandwich.
Don't bother.
You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.
Michael?
Don't turn on the light.
What happened, Michael!?
Nanook...
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  He bit me!  This is my blood!
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What??
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
I don't know.
Star.
Who are you calling?
The Marines.
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Huh?...
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
Why?
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
What?
I'll try to be more careful.
The thing's kind of heavy.
No, I just meant...
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
I guess.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
You sent that?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
I'm asking you to leave.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
What's he like?
Good-looking?
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Loser? You?
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Nah.
Never?
Well once. Mary.
Mary again.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
Well why don't you look her up?
Why not?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
I don't know about this, Dom.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Well... at least now you know.
What's so funny?
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Never met him.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Mary's a babe!
What?
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
Well think about it.
No You mean...?
Uh-huh.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Yeah feels like it.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
Shoot.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Well? What are you waiting for?
I don't know what to say.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
Mints?
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
You know, clean the pipes.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
No.
Why's that?
I'm usually too tired to be.
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Huh.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Jesus Christ you're right.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
People get hurt that way.
Dom? What are you?
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Out getting coffee.
Mary.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
Who?
Who?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Call you back.
'That right?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Healy you dog!
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Here's the info you asked for.
Thanks.
Stalker, huh?
Big time.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Relax, he just ate.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Healy, what I just tell you?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
No I can't.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Am I?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
You found my car?!
So where the hell are you, Healy?
The sawbones?
Yep.
Oh yeah.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Ahh.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Thanks.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
No thanks.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
You own a home there?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
Thanks.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?
Pat Healy.
Don't you want to know my name?
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
It's right there on your golf bag.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
Are you... an architect?
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
What's that?
I work with retards.
I beg your pardon?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
No, I mean
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
-- He's in a cage?!
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
That sounds like fun.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Great.
Fine. Fine.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
A surprise?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Deco.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That...? Vestibule.
How about -- ?
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
You're a movie buff?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Have you seen it?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Yeah.
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
So...
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
I guess.
Mary ah, forget it.
What?
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Fuck!!
Huh... that's strange.
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
All set.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Forget it. It was... fun.
Urrggghh...
Warren!
Are you okay?
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Uh-huh.
Any idea where I might start looking?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Well, I know you're busy...
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't buy it.
You don't buy what?
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Really?  Very, very?
I think your life's about to change.
So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she hasn't changed?
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
No, not at all.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
So she's married?
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
Three different guys?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
She's in a wheelchair?!
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Uh, that's okay.
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
What are you doing?
Miami?
Jai alai?
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Good good.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Surprised?
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
What do you mean 'why'?
Answer the question, shitball.
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Do what?
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Oh Christ... poor dog.
You're a sick man, you know that?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Your turn?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What?
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Same here.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Harvard?
You bet.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
You mean him.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
You know, I really should take your card.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
You what?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Bullshit!
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
And you met Mary how?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Friend. Baseball bat.
Nice.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Why you son of a --
Fucking sickening.
How many is that?
Four.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
I never said that.
Ho-ly shit.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
You little fuck.
What?
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
You were following us?
Oh... Sully.
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
That must make it tough.
Hm?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
I see where you're going.
How do you guarantee that?
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
What's that supposed to mean?
No I'm not.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Ah, she's okay.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Have you been up all night again?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Meaning?
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
So who's the lucky guy?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Good lookin'?
He's no Steve Young.
What's he like?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I don't watch the new ones.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Bundt cake?
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Healy.
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Why?
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
An old flame?
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Holy shit...
Puffy, get over here.
Magda!
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Where's Puffy?
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
Pat's an architect, too.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Where would I have seen your work?
What's up, Doc?
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
You don't think they're too big?
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
What's up?
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
I think you'd better sit down.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Mary, the man's a killer.
What...?
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
You mean he's not a criminal?
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
So who you taking to the prom?
Huh?
The prom -- you going?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Hi, Ted.
Hi, Mary.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Are you all right?
Oh yeah.
Ted, are you okay?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
You betcha!
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Who's that?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
And did everything -- ?
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Really? I never got a message.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
By the way, how's he doing?
He's dead.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Oh... are you... ?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Hey.
Thanks.
What's that?
On your ear, you've got something.
Sure.
Oh great, I ran out.
Now by killer, you mean...?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
What are you?
Twenty-two.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Yeah?
We've got a lot in common.
Well... why don't you move back?
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
So you're a writer?
Trying to be.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Why not?
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
All right, let's go.
Yeah, sure.
Toy poodle!
Get out.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Please leave.
Mary, come on...
Okay.
You're Woogie?
What what are you doing here?
Ted...?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
But but what about Steve?
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
Get over here.
Really.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
I wish.
Shhhhhh!
What?! No please, sir --
One guess.
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
No, that's really unneces --
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
What do you mean?
No, no, please!
I wasn't trying --
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
No! I was pissing!
So what's up?
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Uh-huh.
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
How are you doing, Warren?
I'm gonna take a rain check.
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
I did.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
What do you mean?
You're kidding.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
Ready as we'll ever be.
Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
You can't fight'em that way...
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
What the hell is that, anyway?
What do you use it for?
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
What?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find me.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  History.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
I might have an idea...
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
You know, up the jeep trail.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
We're not going over there, right?
So...now what?
Could we make it to the mountains?
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
You didn't cook breakfast?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Has a lot of rain.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Do not talk to the driver.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Well, sure.
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
You gotta ask that?
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get really serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves.  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right now?
I'll call that little bluff.  How close?
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
That's the plan.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
So long, cactus!
Adios, bridge!
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
You're full of shit.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he wanted to kill himself?
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
I'll go with that plan.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!!
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Those assholes are supposed to be fixing the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
You're hung up again.
I am not!
Fuck you!
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
I've decided not to run for President.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
A man who plans ahead.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Screw you.  For all you know they could fly.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
The rifle.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Great.  Thank you.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Here's the plan...We don't even stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
That is the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Why would they do it?
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
Oh shit!
What the hell are they?
Sons of bitches!
This is one big mother!
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of anything like this before?
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on this for no measly fifteen bucks!
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
We'll take your word for it.
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Prairie dog burrow...
Little sons of bitches.
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
I think we wait right here.
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a goddamned bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
Me, too.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Don't he have a home to go to?
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
You go north, I'll go south.
Right.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
I'm gonna help you.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
How the hell long it take you to change a tire?
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
We need another plan.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Its tires are flat...
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull anything.
Well...all right!  We just roll on out of here!
We got a plan!
I'm making the run to the Cat.
Like hell you are.
I'm best at driving the Cat.
Only if something happens to me.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
Use the fucking bomb!
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
I want to live for the three days.
What the hell are you doing?!!
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Not yet, not yet...
Road's in!
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in People magazine...
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Yeah...but no ties.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Civil?  I'm civil.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
Somebody paying you to do this?
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
What?
She likes both of us.  We both helped her out.
You are so full of shit...
Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Burt!  Heather!
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
Could be.
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Twenty.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
And...
Bond... James Bond.
Yeah, geography.
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Around here?  Why would they?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as weird vibes.  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Darn it!
You okay?
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Think it's still following us?
Let's assume that it is.
Ready?
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
It does.
What's it doing?
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
They're working together, too.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
I want Debbie.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
No.
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be some way!
Like what?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
Good point.
It worked!  There they go!
LET'S DO IT!
Seventy-five hundred.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
What is this person's story here?
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
I don't want any trouble.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
The best.
I love that car.
The car for Debbie?
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
So does Debbie.
Maybe it had something to do.
Shit!
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: 24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL! Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Fan out and look for them.
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes I did.
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Sure have...
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir, I am.
I've tried to change her mind.
But how can I do that?
Thanks for the advise, sir.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
1002
Yes, sir.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Cole, we've got to talk.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
God, you're a slob.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
I think your dinner's burning.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
It looks awful.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Huh? Wha...
I can't sleep.
Oh... I got something for that.
What's the matter?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
About what?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
C'mere.
Good...
Um... that's very relaxing.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
You better not have too much joy.
Gonna get married...
Can't I just go with you guys?
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Your mother's not dead.
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
I love you.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Why don't you get undressed.
I can't trust you!
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Rick, you're lying!
Let go of me!
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I am committed. I love you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Let's get naked.
You're on.
You're so romantic...
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Let's go.
Great, Mom.
Why is Cole here?
Ilene, we don't really know that.
Quiet, Mother.
I hope those guys are all right.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
It's more
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
It's true.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Hookers beat you up?
I didn't know you were into that.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
So, Larry, how have you been?
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Is that all the coke in the place?
Good.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
What do you mean, it changes?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
You okay?
Really?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Are any of those right?
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Oops!
Can't I just maim it a little?
I'd love that.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Feel free.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Oh, no!
The end.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
He's fine. He's narrating.
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
You all right, Professor Tripp?
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Where'd she go?
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
You snore.
So I hear.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
It's the Chancellor.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Tripp!
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
You're stoned.
She's still a transvestite.
Mm.
Isn't she?
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
I thought you were tinkering.
I just mean...
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
He said something about being between things.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Trip??
She left me. Crabs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
Is that just beer?
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
He finished it Winter Break.
So. Is he any good?
No. Not yet he isn't.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
He is. Take my word for it.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Shut up and drink.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Not Curtis.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Because... because...
That was good.
He heard everything we were saying.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Yes.
What's this guy's problem?
What's the matter?
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Shit.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Where would we go?
Tripp?!
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
James? My James? What's happened?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Kidnapped? By who?
His parents.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Maybe... I don't know.
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Only in your bones?
How bad is it for you?
Which is?
Competence.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
What's to tell?
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
We'll spend an hour with Nymphos Without Pants...
Olivier's in that, right?
Then it's on to the real thing.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
So modest.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out...
Crabtree.
Ye-es?
Is he awake?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
Shut up, James.
So what's the problem?
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
Who do you think it is?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
Find the jacket.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Want some help with that?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
The hood jumper?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
Such as.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
...we find the jacket.
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
This isn't right.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Call it a hunch.
Naturally you have copies.
That was MacCaulay.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
Came to my senses.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
Me? What can I do?
I peeked.
How are you -- is it Joe?
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
No...
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
It's mine.
You must be mistaken.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
I'm not really hungry.
C'mon. I insist.
I passed out.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
The last month maybe.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
I've been trying to finish a book...
Is that in my chart?
I know.
She told you about...
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Vernon.
Who's got a gun?
Relax, Vernon...
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
No, really...
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
'Fraid so.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Boy or girl?
What the hell is that?
My gift to you.
Under the table!
The best table in the house.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Sure.
Hello?
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
Yes. But that's not why I called...
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
...reconcile with Emily.
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Yea?
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
...You carry firearms.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
No! What gave you that idea?
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Sounds like a good one.
It's not bad.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
Well...
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Really? That's remarkable.
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
So long, Father.
You cold, James?
A little.
So what are you doing out here?
It's colder in there.
You're right.
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
I'll miss my bus.
This is worth it.
That's really it.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
So I'm told.
Really?
Really.
They're glass. The buttons.
Like the lady herself.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
I had to. Didn't I?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Yea, James.
What are we going to do with...
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
You?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
I've got tenure.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Miss Sloviak's.
Can I ask you something about her?
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
You're welcome.
Rick, I'm concerned.
About what?
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Oooooo.
Right in there, pal.
That's the old Rick!
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
I put you on the floor.
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Want me to get that?
Who?
The guy on the phone.
What'd he say?
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
What'd you tell him?
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
Afraid so.
That's a big book you're writing.
But... ?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Washed up?
Blocked.
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
Professor Tripp?
Hm.
How did I get here last night?
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
How's that?
Well done, James.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
The bus station.
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
But James. I mean... How long?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Who?
I don't know...  Me.
Isn't this...?
Hm.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Yeah, well, actually...
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
No.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Your aunt?
Humboldt County?
Maybe...
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Colon cancer.
Jesus, James. Wow.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Where's that?
Carvel.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Outside Scranton.
I never heard of it.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
When we fall, we fall hard.
Amazing.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
Kinship. And what's here?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
That's right. That one.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
How can you tell?
You can see the outline of a butt.
Who was that?
I don't know.
What's this?
Got me.
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
I just wanted a little sip.
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
So, why did you take me up there?
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
It's warm.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Because of my coat?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Jealous? Of me?
Not you. Your talent.
How 'bout this?
Still drawing a blank.
You're lying.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
I never said that.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. Is he any good? he said. And you said: Not yet he isn't. I heard you myself.
I didn't mean it that way.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
But, last night...
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
I'm sorry.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
You coming?
In a minute. Get us a table.
No thanks.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
What would you call them then?
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
It's because you don't eat.
I eat.
When?
When nobody's looking.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Okay.
Where you going?
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
I'm not going, with them.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Near Carvel?
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
He look familiar?
Very.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Get out of here.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
Professor Tripp...?
Yes, James.
Even if I end up going to jail....
Yes, Hannah?
Thanks for that. He all right?
I think so... What about you?
Me? Sure. Why?
Just checking.
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
James'll know about George Sanders.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
I thank you.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
So what are you going to do?
I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Oh. Well. I...
Hey.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
But where? I need the street.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
Hey, you guys...
Who's your friend?
He cribbed that from Borges.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
That good, huh?
No, it's not that, it's...
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
Professor Tripp.
Chancellor.
I got the message you called.
I got the message you called too.
Easy there.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
I need to talk to you.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
New?
All right. This morning --
I'm sure.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
Emily left me this morning.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Simple.
Is that Cristaile?
Hm.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Has he asked to see the book yet?
And? Are you going to tell him?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Neither do I.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Is the thing -- is it over?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Well...
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
Not have it.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Who's gun is that?
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Caps.
Pow.
You got me.
I love you, Grady.
What are you going to do about it?
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
I'll stop him... You stall him.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
I heard.
Did you confess?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Really? That was fast.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
Really, Sara, I...
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
About the baby.
What's he doing out there?
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
Sara.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Oh?
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
Inside.
And the jacket?
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Someone stole my car.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Are you sure you parked it there?
Reach out and snort someone.
I'm saved. Let's party!
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
Would Walter really press charges?
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
I think I might have.
And what do you think you might have said?
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
He told you.
He told me.
I said it didn't sound like you.
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I'm through improvising.
I lost it all.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
And you're old.
Ouch. How many?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
I guess you have to go on faith.
Some times...
Did you tell Walter?
I told Walter.
Does he still love you?
It didn't come up.
Did you just make that up?
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
You don't deserve me, you know.
I know, but sometimes...
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Debbie.
My Debbie?
What's with her costume?
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Lucky guess.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I'm your man.
James is... I don't know...
I'm not sure that's possible.
Listen, Antonia --
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
He's writing his name in water.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Walter?
You got it.
It's Grady, Walter.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
This is important.
I'm in love with your wife.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
No.
Oh... yeah.
I don't know. It might be...
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Taking the long way home.
Yo, Traxler.
Do you get high, Sam?
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
As a heart attack.
What made you pull out that old thing?
And?
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean Goodbye.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
That's weird.
The perpetrator.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Are you riding with me, James?
No, I'm going ho --
George Sanders?
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
Just a few then. The big ones.
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
I haven't heard of half of those.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
I doubt it, darling.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
Right... Think it over.
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hopefully.
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. Mister
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Eh?
We'd be thrown out.
They are?
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Well! A boy of your age bowling hoop at people. How old are you anyway?
Eight and two thirds.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Shurrup!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Well --
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Y'what?
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
I'm a deserter.
Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What they like?
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
How about Ding Dong?
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
Why aren't you at work?
I'm a deserter, too.
What about all these letters?
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
Can you fix him for me?
Sixpence.
He'll be pulp by now.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Leave them drums alone.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Well!
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Yeah, you know, O.K. Buster
Ever seen one of these before?
I see you go to the night court.
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
Are you going in?
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
Bag-snatcher.
I don't snore.
Do I snore?
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
No. I don't.
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Grotty?
Yeah, grotesque.
But I won't.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
I beg your pardon?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Get him out of here!!
Have I said something amiss?
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
That's not your Grandfather.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
A butcher?
Yeah, she was fickle.
Gerron.
No, straight up.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Well, let's broaden our outlook.
Sure. .
Ah well. Eh, look!
What's up?
He's sulking again.
Ringo!
Wake up!
You crawler.
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
He hasn't.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Sorry.
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
He comes from a large family.
Should I say it?
Follow your impulse.
I don't think that bit's right.
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
What are we waiting for?
It's Paul's grandfather.
Well, what happened?
Sorry.
Oh!
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
Are you supposed to be here?
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
How'd you guess?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Are you pulling my leg?
I see.  Do you like the play?
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Gear?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Thank you.
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
I'm not ...
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Yes.
Aye, I knew you were.
What's that mean?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  I don't believe you
The big hammer?
Oh aye, a sledge.
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
They ought to be.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
What are you?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Why selfish?
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
And cunning.
And what do you do about it?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Pity.
Yes.
See you.
Of course.
Ah.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
You can learn from books.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Out where?
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Books are good!
Parading's better!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Well, I am living, aren't I?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
So you are a man after all.
What's that mean?
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
Yeah ... that's right.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
A book!
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
You're only right.
Where are you off to?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
What?
Have they?
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
Me!
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
What are you doing?
Lip reading.
Nothing good.
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
You see, sly villains.
Hello, Grandfather!
Hello.
He can talk then?
And we're looking after him, are we?
I'll look after meself.
Come on let's get this coffee.
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
Every morning.
That'll keep you busy.
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ...
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
But I'm clean.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
Don't dramatise.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Yeah ... so what?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Here, Pauly.
No, that's his other one.
Clean though, isn't he?
Well, what are we waiting for?
What are you doing there?
I think you're soft or something.
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
What little old man?
That little old man.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Oh, I see.
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
He's got you worried, then?
Gie's a kiss!
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Give 'em a pull.
Shall I?
I hope he fell off.
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Like what?
Well, I've got me gob stopper.  Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
Let's go and muck in.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Behave...
Foreign devil ...
What's he know?
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
What's old got to do with it?
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
You're a swine, isn't he George?
He started it.
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
No.
Ah, go on, you swine.
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
I'll brook no denial!
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.
Now get on with it.
We were going to do it.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Let's have you.
Come on speedy!
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
You wouldn't!
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important.
Hi Norm!
Hi, our lot!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Now, look here, Norm ...
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Hello.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
No, not me.
Oh you are, I know you are.
No, I'm not.
You are.
I'm not, no.
Well, you look like him.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Oh you do, look.
My eyes are lighter.
And my nose...
Is it?
I would have said so.
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
What have you heard?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Is it? Is it really?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
I knew I could rely on you.
Thanks.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
It'll only get you into trouble.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Oh, leave off!!!
Well ...
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
He'll get over it.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
And?
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
I knew it, he started it, I should have known.
Y'what?
Have you lost him?
Don't exaggerate.
You've lost him.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Aren't we ...
No, we're not!
Where's my grandfather?
Don't start. Look.
He belongs to Paul.
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
None for me, then?
Sorry.
That's mine.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Well ...
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Good lad, Ringo.
Stop picking on him.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
What do you think are you're up to?
Someone put it on me.
Look after him.
But...
Do I have to raise me voice?
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
He's been gone a long time.
Paul's grandfather.
That's too easy for Lennon.
What?
I know, that's the trouble.
Clever.  George.
Shurrup, cheerful.
How's that?
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
And they want me?
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
You were twanging too loud.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Get knotted!
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
I'll set John on you!
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
I'll do it.
-- Thanks, coach --
Sorry, coach.
Great evening, isn't it?
Suck me...beautiful?
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Like what?
...okay...
I'm not good in math.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
This is your plan, Finch?
This.  Right now.
Of course, Finch.  What?
What are we gonna hear?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
No idea.
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Just go!
You're gonna shit your pants!
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not all that I am.
Of course, I didn't --
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say Oh
Yeah...so like, what else do you do?
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, kicked butt.
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Neither will I.
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Nice car.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
What?!
What?  No I'm not.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to.
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
Hi...
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
You talked to Stifler?
Uh...my dad's the manager.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
That's nice.
So you're going to Michigan?
Onions?
What?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, What're you gonna major in? And I don't know.  And they're like, You'll figure it out.  Yeah?  When?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
Sure.
So we're gonna be close next year?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...yeah.
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
What about the game?!
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
What's that?
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
This isn't any better, Chris.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
You called me Oz.
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
I know, it sucks!
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
Then don't.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Yeah right.
What?  We both have cars.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
That's not why we're going out.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Please.
He likes it.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I think I've had one.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Sure.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
What?
I'll give you a hint.  Ohhh
You mean...and orgasm?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
No.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Of course.
Do you love her?
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
No comment.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding?  No.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, Jessica
I don't get it, that really works?
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
Yeah, that's right.
Uh...
And you said...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You think she was serious?
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, I love you grandma or I love you Vanderbilt.
There's our man.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
Unlisted age, plus youthful mind
No, Charming is old.  Older is really old.  Youthful mind is dead.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
You can crash at Stifler's?
It's all good.  Breath check.
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Gotta go.
But --
Ow, what the hell?
No, a pact.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Pontificated.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Right.  That gives us...
Exactly three weeks to the day.
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Yeah, enormous.
Hey, where's Finch?
Went home to shit.
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
You can send me the address too.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Just in time.
But, but -- what would I do?
That's stupid.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Please, God.  Let this be it.
He's going in!
Holy shit!
Hey, minuteman.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
How do you know that?
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
You fuckin' rule!
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
I'm not going.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Dad, come in.
Okay.
I know, Dad.
Dad!  I know!
Thank you, dad, I got it.
It's not what it looks like!
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Yes.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Dad.
Dad!!
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
What was your name again?
Michelle.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Yes.  Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Highly, highly overrated.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
I told you.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Yeah, bring it on!
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Okay, I get it.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
This'll do.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
She's a mermaid, dude.
A hot cartoon.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
C-Span?
You guys got the Latin homework?
Ooh, here's an easy one:  Attractive SWF
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Who cares?
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
So do I, Kev.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
I know.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
After getting laid?
After high school.
You've got something going?
You did it.
Yes.
Me?
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Well...uh...
Uh...yeah...sorry.
You mean like, strip strip?
Uh...
Um...okay...
Oh no.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
God dammit, Stifler!
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
Ho-lee shit.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
You think so?
You got in.
Oh, Kev.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Tonight?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Let me know.
Okay, don't stop.
Vicky, wait.
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
I think shithead really says it.
How?
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
That's my trick!
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
You want to do it?
Yes --
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us.  Something good. Something special.
But you don't love me.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Okay.
Hey...
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Now?!
No...I know the perfect time...
See -- this is the nicest room.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
You comfortable?
Yeah.
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.
Me too.
Yeah, right here.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
I don't know.  How do you?
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
I want to hear you say it.
Okay.
Victoria...I love you.
I love you.
That was a great night.
Yeah.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
It did.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
What?  Not the Bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Ready for what?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
What?!  How do I do that?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
Then she said -- she loves me.
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Once, in church, dude.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
What reputation?
Observe.
Okay, explain.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Kevin, it was just a --
...Guess what?
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
He didn't?
I think we're falling in love.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Fuck yeah we will.
NOVA!!
Stifler!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
That junior chick?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Bullshit.  From where?
Dude, he does not.
Keep it down, dude.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot.
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Yeah!
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
No shit.
Yep.
Here, babe.
Uh huh.
Doing what?
No way.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Yeah. Apparently.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
AHHHHHHH!
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Ha-ha!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Sure. I can follow that.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
Salots! Shitfucker!
What?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Like an underground club?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
And who's Claude?
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Andy!
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Andy! Holy shit!
Serafine...?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
So... you feel okay now?
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
What about your glasses?
It's okay. I can see fine.
Don't you want to change?
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
A la votre.
This looks familiar...
Serafine...
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
I know. He told me.
What?! He told you? When?
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Andy! No!
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
What makes you so sure this will work?
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I don't know...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
They're coming!
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Are you crazy!?
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
What the fuck!? You too!?
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Yeah. French fries...
Holy mother of God...
Fuck me...
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
We don't both have to die.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
I know where he'll go.
Where?
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
Didn't even have to ask.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
God. I can't believe it.
What?
What does it say?
Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead.
Whoa...
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Right.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Okay. Be careful.
You too.
Oh God. Shit...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
No... I...
Shit!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Or else what? You'll kill me?
You'll never get the chance.
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Claude...?
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Sure. Don't you?
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Looks like he lied to you too.
What?!
Oh shit... No...
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
What about me?
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
Psychic awareness. Right.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
What?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or Daydream. It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Andy...
Yeah?
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Not you too -
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed.  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
I don't believe we've been introduced.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus...
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Uncle Terrence.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Because Gaston was after it.
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
I told him it wasn't ready...
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Uncle Terrence?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Where is it! Please!
Claude.
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Jesus...
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his hippie brother. Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
What do you mean, maniacs?
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Shit. I feel sick.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -
Andy!
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
You fucking liar!
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
I need a large polo mallet!
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
What do you mean, next?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Yes.
Why not?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
It's okay.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Yes.
Do you feel all right?
Allison.
Yeah? Allison what?
Portchnik.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
We've been through this.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Well, why not?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Lyndon Johnson?
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Tsch.
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of The Godfather.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Two minutes, Alvy.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
Well, stop listening to him.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
How can you possibly oversleep?
The alarm clock.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
Stop it, Alvy!
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
Oh!
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
Alvy, I...
What-what-what-what's the matter?
I-you know, I don't wanna.
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
M'm.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Oooh! Here! Here!
Get him!
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
All right. All right. All right.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
He was creepy.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like la- de-da...
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
You-you play... very well.
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, You play well
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Oh, no, I have a car.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say Do you have a car?... like you wanted a lift?
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Me? Oh, downtown!
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
So sorry.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Yeah.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
No, Chippewa Falls.
Right!  Where?
Wisconsin.
Uh, you're driving a-
Well, where is it? I-
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
For yuh.
Okay, that's good.
All right.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Oh, right.
Nice car.
Huh?
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Don't be funny.
You want your tennis stuff?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
You want your gear? Here you go.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Oh.
And I love what you're wearin'.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Your grammy!
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Well...
Well... thank you again.
I'll see yuh.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
You sure?
No, I got time.
Okay.
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Fifteen years?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
Sylvia Plath.
M'hm...
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, sorry.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Neat?
Neat, yeah.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that neat went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Duane?
Well, who's Sadie?
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Uh, narcolepsy.
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Why not?
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Fifteen years, huh?
God bless.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Oh, thank you.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
I know.
what I mean?
think that's, uh-
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
No, so help me.
it's my first time.
Yeah.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
No, I'm gonna quit!
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Really, do you think so, really?
Yeah!
Yeah?
It's terrific.
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
Really?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Yeah.
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Oh, all right.
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
We can digest our-
Okay. Yeah.
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
As Balzac said...
H'm?
There goes another novel.  Jesus, you were great.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Here, you want some?
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
Yeah?
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
What? What?
Hey?
H'm?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Yeah?
big subject with me, yeah.
Yeah?
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
M'hm.
Those are the two categories...
M'hm.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
M'hm.
And blind people, crippled...
Yeah.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
M'hm.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
U-huh.
Look, look at that guy.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Look at these guys.
Yeah.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Oh, yeah?
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
No, I'm not.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Ooooh!
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
You- Do you love me?
Do I love you?
That's the key question.
Yeah.
I know you've only known me a short while.
Yeah.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Yeah.
I dunno.
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Of course.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
You don't want me to live with you?
Mine.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
How is it any different?
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Yes, it is.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Well, have you ever made love high?
It relaxes me.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, come, you don't need that.
What are you doing?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
No, I'm fine.
Really?
U-huh.
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Let's just do it, all right?
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Oh, you have my body.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
M'hm.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Were you always funny?
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Are yuh?
Yeah.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
You're so sure about it.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Yeah.
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
I didn't follow you!
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Well, what is your definition of following?
Following is different. I was spying.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course Contemporary Crisis in Western Man!
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Neat! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! He thinks I'm neat.
Who cares? Who cares?
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
David? You call your teacher David?
It's his name.
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
I'm home!
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
M'm.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
M'hm.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Sinatra?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Yeah?
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Will it change your wife?
Will it change my life?
Life. I said, life.
She said, Will it change my wife. You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
David! David! I can't believe this!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
What's- It's me, open up.
Oh.
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
There's a spider in the bathroom.
What?
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Oooh.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
It was just great!
Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the National Review? What are you turning in to?
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Is he in the bathroom?
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Oh. What?
Very big spider.
Yeah?
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
Two?
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
snow shovel or anything or something.
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, Jesus, really?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
W-w-whatta you mean?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Oh, I had the radio on.
Yeah?
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Yeah.
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
I don't know.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Okay, okay. Okay.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Holy cow!
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Oh, darn it.
Happy birthday.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Here's a real present.
Check it out.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
Remember, we had that thing.
Thing?
yes, we had, uh...
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my...
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
That's sick!
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
God, it's so clean out here.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Christ!
Nothing at all?
Yeah, this place is great.
Yeah.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Oh, good. Okay.
I'm cool.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Whose Catcher in the Rye is this?
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
This Denial of Death. You remember this?
Oh-
This is the first book that I got you.
Remember that day?
Thanks, honey.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
What?
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Yeah.
I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
You look very pretty.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read Death in Venice.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word death in the titles.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You're mad, aren't you?
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
I'm late.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
The what?
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Oh!
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
I did.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Why are you so hostile?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Commentary.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
Here you are. There's people out there.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere...
Oh, I'm sorry!
Don't get upset!
Dammit! I was so close.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
I can't.
My head is throbbing.
Oh, you got a headache!
I have a headache.
Bad?
Oswald and ghosts.
Jesus!
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
Man, that's great. That's just great.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Tsch, a few.
Are you?
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Key word here is indulgent.
What are you depressed about?
I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
Probably on their first date, right?
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Trigger.
Charlie Chaplin.
Hey.
Right before his un-American thing.
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Yeah, I love it there.
Sixteen years ago.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, Jew.
You're crazy!
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, Jew.
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, Did you eat yet or what? and Tom Christie said, No
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Stop calling me Max.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, Yes
Right, Max. California, Max.
Ah.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Forget it, Max.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Yeah, watch the road!
You'll total the whole car.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
I have some very good memories there.
Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Oh.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Max, I've got a hit series.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Look, uh...
We do the show live in front of an audience.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
What's the matter?
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Well, sit down.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
You wanna lie down?
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
How about a ginger ale?
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
You like this house, Max?
M'hm.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
What difference does that make?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Where?
The one with the V.P.L.
V.P.L.?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
There are no twos, Max.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
M'hm.
How do you like this couple, Max?
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
We're gonna operate together.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Yes, I do.
You think so? Do you really?
I just have time to get the, uh-
Oh.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Well, hi!
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
No, no, no, not at all.
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
Oh. What about?
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Yeah.
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Hey-
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Oh.
It was a wonderful set.
Oh, gosh.
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
There's a whole wing in this house.
I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
There were many men interested in you?
Did you know the contractor?
To code?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Why didn't you come in?
Would it make a difference?
You're fucking desperate.
One guess.
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
Absolutely.
Had a little help?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
I'm not that good.
What's that?
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
Why last?
It's going.  It's going.
Isn't Skye amazing?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
And you've only just met.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
Well you did.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
No, what?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Who, Sally?
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more... And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Leo?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
I have a small window of time.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
Honey?
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
Why didn't you bring him?
What?
Oh.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Well, probably.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
Oh.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
Borrow whatever you like.
I'll change back before we leave.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
I'd say it was down.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
Why would she care?
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Just don't fucking tell her.
It's not going to come up.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Don't you miss it?
Never.
Really.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
So where is young Jonah?
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
What is that thing?
You should have brought him.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Oh my God, the sitter.
Thanks for coming.
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
I love her too, Joe.
He's gonna miss his flight.
Yeah.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
And you're not the wife.
It's not a contest.
Damn straight.
Count on it.
I'm the hired help.
Fuck you.
I never put myself in harm's way.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Who are you revolting against?
Please.
Delacroix.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
Sally?
Please?
Directing suits you.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
When does he graduate high school?
Oh, very jealous.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
You really need to be fucked.
Escape hatch.
Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
I love you, Joe Therrian.
What is it?
Let's go upstairs, okay?
The suspense is killing me.
Harry called.
And?
But she's alright.
She's in ICU.
She left a note.
Fuck you.
You need to call your dad.
Leave us alone right now.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
Monica.
We live next door.
Excuse me?
You don't have the demographics.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
That's mighty black of you.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Nice to meet you.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
There's a test, you know.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Are you my big hard hero?
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah?
Let me heal you, baby.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
I call that a perfect day.
A perfect night.
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Not as a rule.
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
Hey!  Would you?
I don't think so.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
Give him a minute, Clair.
Anytime, sport.
Probably not.
What's your name?
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
We closed.
Fantastic.  Out here.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
I adore him.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
We've only been over this how many times?
You only made half your quote this year.
Well, you're a tower of support.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
Not millions.
They're paying him scale.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
We'll be fine.
Did you invite them?
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Yes.
Scout's honor.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
Just do what I say, alright?
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Take your time, Jer.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
Ryan's novel.
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
Happy anniversary, baby.
Happy anniversary.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Hardly...
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
What did you get me?
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
Kiss the back of my knees.
Through the sweats or not?
Not.
What?
No.  Did you?
No.  I missed that.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
We're great.
I mean, you're really back.
For good.
Don't get it.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
What?
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
I'm going to throw up.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Really?
I'll say as little as possible.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Otis!  No barking!
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
In the kitchen.
Yes.
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
It's taken care of.
Two minutes.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Still champions.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
It's an unfair advantage.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce?
Truce.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Dolphins.  Great.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Don't be so sure.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
Fuck you.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Otis!!!!
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
Otis!
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Love?
You walked out on a five year marriage.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
It's not like this all the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
And how hard it hit?
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
That is not true.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
It's a novel.
About me!
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
What are you saying?
Hello?  Last birthday was?
I don't look my age, Joe.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
Cal, too?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
Don't.
Don't push me away.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't do this.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
Don't do this!
You changed your mind.
I wanted you back.
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You're not ready.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Yes.
I'll never forgive you.
I have no idea who you are.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
Everybody hates the messenger.
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
I'll be with you.
I don't want to go tonight.
You don't have to.
No.
Okay.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
I guess.
Me too.
Me too.
Happy anniversary.
He's my favorite.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Ah...
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Oh, Sally Mae...
I know.
Will you make love with me?
Sure.
Panes!  How are you?
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
What's a sign for that?
Sure.
We have a gift?
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Lovely.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Yes, she is.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's a novel.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Yes.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Don't I find what?
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Not long.
Don't be silly.
Joking.
Do I put you off?
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
And I you.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Ah.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
Mmm hmmm.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Ours.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Ah there's our snookums now.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
I meant Sally.
Oh.  You're serious.
Please, Ryan.
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
Something soft.
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Sally did all this herself?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
Uh-huh.
I'm a little nervous, so...
Oh.
A little out of my element.
No you're not.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Very well put.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
What?
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Elitism?
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And you know, he really does not.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.
Easy tiger.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Scout's honor.
I'll be your best friend.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
We're way past inappropriate.
I will treasure this.
Sally!!!!
Are you okay?
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Let's go for a walk.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
I've never done this before.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
What am I, five?
Lemon or raspberry?
Lemon.
Lemon it is.
Ryan's really angry with me.
I think he's really angry with me too.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
I'm sorry.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's a lot of those.
Yes.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Come here.
I like you.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
I'm so sorry.
It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis.
How do you do, Skye?
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
I think there are sixteen there.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Of course it's alright.
I didn't say a word.
What's that?
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
Well...wow...
Not good.
I'm sure you understand.
Well, yes, actually.
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
Yes.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
They're nothing like us.
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
I don't need a drug.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
Ready to go?
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
You're not serious.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Why?
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
Excuse me?
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
Don't go in, Ryan.
What?
Let's just go home, okay?
You ain't happy about the green light?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Sally?
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
We could hardly say no.
Oh?
Ryan!
Are you working on a new book?
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Yes.
I so wish I'd known.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
I did it.
I'm sorry.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm so sorry.
I...
How long ago was it?
Come on in.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
No, never.
Is there space here?
Do you need anything else?
No, no thanks.
I was impressed.
Oh?
Thank you.
Oh?
The Shostakovich.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Do Peter Sellers again.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Would you, like, marry him?
If he were still alive, maybe.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you asking me to marry you?
Very.
Must be the pressure.
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Are you lovesick?
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Will champagne help?
Not enough.
Panes is here!
Oh great.
She's even better looking in the flesh.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
You don't know she's a bitch.
It could be worse.
How?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
You see, that's worse.
Like your business managers?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
How are you really doing, Panes? Lousy
Like the last time.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
Like the last time.
I wasn't finished.
We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while? I'd love to
It's our anniversary, Panes.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here.
You know it's true.
Everyday.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
Shit!
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
What does that mean?
About five thousand dollars.  With my discount.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
Yes.  Fine.
I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
I never like to talk about my work.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
No.  Not something new.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Um.  Happy for you.
Thanks.
So tell me, how's it going?
You're my best friend.
That's not an answer, is it?
Yes, you're a monster.
Thank you, Panes.
You don't need to thank me.
We're going to have to go back out there.
I guess.
Panes?
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
What did I do?
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Yes.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
You're keeping a record, are you?
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Monica and Ryan.
Rose.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
I'll be right out.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
What are they?
You don't need to do that.
Relax.  You've done enough.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
Enough about me.
Evie has a little something for you.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
And here they are!
He's a novelist.
Ah.
I hope they're watercolors!
Nevermind.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
Yes.
She's such a great photographer.
Hm.
So where should I put it?
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
The both of you.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
So how much do you hate her?
Big time.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
And the food sucks, I know.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Well good.  Thank God.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Oh honey, let's.
What do you mean, thank God?
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
You weren't exactly horrified.
I don't have a drug problem.
Neither does Joe.
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Not nice.  Not kind.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Why are you doing this?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  Oh now I'm a novelist
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Meaning?
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Z?  Our Z?  The little guy made it!
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
No -- an individual!
Right...because every ant's important!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
Because...because he's twice the ant that you are.  I could never go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an individual, and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose.
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
Good morning, Cheeba.
De-la-croix.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
What?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
You're right!
You -- you think I'm right?
Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
And you are...?
Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
You dance...
Divinely?
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
No...as a matter of fact...
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
That's not what you said the other night --
-- At the worker bar!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
No offense.
What was that thing?
How should I know?
I order you to find out where we are!
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Look around, sweetheart.
I -- hate -- you.
Well I guess that makes us even.
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Oh come on, you're the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
I was slumming it!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Insectopia?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  That direction.
Worker!  Come back here now!
I've got a name.  It's Z.
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
Water...water...
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
We're going to die!
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me?
Want a list?
Wait, I hear something!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Listen, Princess, you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
Out here I'm just what?
Hlllllllp!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're not going to rescue you?
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
And only you can become a Queen?
Well...no, but --
So what makes you so special?
Well...I am the oldest.
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
We've found it!  Insectopia!  Look at all this food'
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's beautiful!
Let's dig in!
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Yes?
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. Insectopia.
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Well, trouble is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
There's something going on, Z --
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to flood the colony!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Oh no...
Different.
Z!  what are you doing?
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've got to warn the others.
I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
A few?
The Club's so stuffy.  I want to try someplace different.
And do Princesses do improper things?
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
You did?
Yes...he's wonderful...
Who is that idiot?
Mom!
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Barbatus?
Barbatus!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
And this is Manray.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
Thank you, sir.
That's correct, sir!
No, sir!
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
ONE TO NOTHING!
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
Well I, I don't think living it up is the right term -- how about working themselves to death?
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a grub.  The whole system just...makes me feel...insignificant.
Why are we so successful?
...Ants...
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
I'll be back.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
Time to cut a rug, Z!
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- bingo!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
I can't think of any.
Well I'm gonna start doing things for you...
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
What do I do?
Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now dig!
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
My mother.
Yeah.  How much?
Not there.  Under the mat.
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Say, you got a lulu.
Oh, I never catch colds.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Twenty-seven.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
I hope everything goes all right.
Fine.  Wait.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
No.
Sure.
You mean tonight?
No. Like a man.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
What time does the show go on?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
How is your cold?
So I see.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
How come?
Oh.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
You shouldn't.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Cheers.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
No -- I like it.
Of course not.
Much better.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Why?
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
I think so.
Here.
What is it?
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
I don't understand --
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
You don't want me here --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Someone from the office.
In his apartment.
I mean -- her apartment.
Miss.
As soon as I can walk.
No -- it's my stomach.
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
He doesn't give a damn about me.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I'm not very good at it.
You don't have to entertain me.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
I don't want it.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
EUREKA!!
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Was he really upset when you told him?
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
You really think so?
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Why not?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Do I have to?
Sure.
Who was that?
Would you mind opening the window?
I just want some fresh air.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Who'd care?
For me?
I don't want to talk to him.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Oh.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I know so. He's a taker.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
You did?
Over a girl?
No, I don't.
Where?
In the knee?
That's terrible.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Are we dressing for dinner?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Shall I light the candles?
I see you bought some napkins.
You usually eat alone?
Cheers.
The dishes?
What?
Oh.
How's everything at the apartment?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I guess so.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
Are you all right?
Mind if I come in?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
Seven --  -- queen.
Shut up and deal!
Baxter?
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Neat...
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
I would like to change your name.
You're now Mantan.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Think.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
That's right, Baxter.
What kind of joint are you running?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Are you going to deny it?
You better.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Where are you going, Baxter?
I'm not through with you yet.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
How would you like to go tonight?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Relax, Baxter.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
You have to start getting into your character.
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
To me?
Oh, yes. Thanks.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
Put me down for Thursday again.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
What?
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Now what was your news, Baxter?
You like?  It's all yours.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Oh?
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
What do you mean, sorry?
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
So what's it going to be?
Now you're being bright?
Mantan!!
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
How you sound?
No costume.  No blackface.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Hi, Baxter.
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
Let me get my bag.
How many pills were in that bottle?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
Want to tell me what happened?
What's her name?
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.
Any of that coffee left?
How do you spell her last name?
It's regulations.
Aren't you?
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Four minutes ago.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
What's this -- you packing?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
Happy New Year.
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Family?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Can I ask you a personal question?
You got a girl-friend?
Still stuck on her, huh.
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
Say, this is Snugsville.
No kidding.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Not so rough, honey.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
My shoes.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Who?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Sleeping pills.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
Get more coffee.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
I took sleeping pills.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
No.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
I don't know.
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
Please -- just let me sleep.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
You fool -- you damn fool.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Will you excuse me?
Well -- thank you.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
Let me take that.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
That's right.
You know I liked it better long.
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
I missed you, Fran.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
It's been hell.
same sauce  sweet And sour.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
I want you back, Fran.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Important?
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Remember what we talked about?
We talked about a lot of things.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
That's enough, Fran.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
You're not being funny.
I wasn't trying.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Handle what?
What do you think?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
You know I do.
Fran --
I love you -- remember?
NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
I promise.
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce. It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Now, Fran --
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Merry Christmas.
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Yeah, we better.
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Stop that, Fran.
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
Coming?
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran.
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
All set for what?
Atlantic City?
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Baxter?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
He wouldn't.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
What are you talking about?
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm telling you it's not.
Sssssh.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Don't you ever stop talking?
Where do you live?
Where does she live?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
What gives?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Go where?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
Lovely. You were a big help.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
It's a thought.
See if they'll what?
Oh -- oh!
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
I've never been given a fair shot.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some nigger show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know niggers set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I'm wid it.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Word!!!
The name of the show?
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
I'm feelin' dis'!
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
That's a great handle.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Exactly!
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
Protest finally forced Amos and Andy off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
Who are the other characters?
Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing Amos and Andy.  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
If Spielburg can direct The Color Purple and Amistad, our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
Dunwitty, don't leave.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Calm down, please.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
This has to be a big mistake.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
What do you want?
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
It's me, Peerless.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
It's been a long time.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Pleased to meet you.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
How did you end up here?
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the life's too short category.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Let's get him over to the bed.
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
I love you too, Daddy.
Always keep 'em laughing.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
What is it you want? What?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
I love you.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
Don't be silly. How bad?
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Do you love me?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
I'm a waitress.
Since forever.
Have they done blood tests on him?
Yes.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Emergency room only.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Me. My home number is on this card.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
I'm starving.
I know. He's just the best.
I've got Jews at my table.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
How long has my father been like this?
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, Thank you. No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
Okay.
I see the help -- judgement call.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
What do you care?
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
No.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
His name?
Spencer.
Okay.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
How old are you?
Oh, please...
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
What's with the dark?
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
You all set here?
What are you doing here?
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
My son is sick, okay?
What about your mother?
How do you know about my mother?
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
No!!! Stay away from me!
Yes.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Note. Put it in the note.
Why did yo do this for me?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
I'm not kidding.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.
So you'll be at work?
Yes.
What's this?
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Getting loud, getting loud.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
So. Anything else?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
What you did changed my life.
He never showed it.
No... no thank you notes.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Nice of you... thank you.
Thank you.
Now I want you to do something for me.
I want you to go on this trip.
No, sir...
The stiff one eye?
I can't. I work.
My son.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What's that got to do with it?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Is there another way to see it?
No.
Are you still coming?
Yes.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Hi.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Thanks, Melvin.
Welcome.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
Nonsense!
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
Hey -- you let him...
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
How was it?
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Nobody told me anything.
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
Dancing?
Stop asking everyone.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
You wanna dance?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
And?
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Okay.
And mean it...
Can we order first?
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
Fries.
One baked -- one fries.
Manray!
Manray!
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Here's the trouble with never.
You don't owe me that.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
If you ask me... I'll say, yes.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
Sex with Simon?
It's one idea...
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
I'll never forget you said it.
It was a mistake.
To hell with sex.
Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't.
This one has a special meaning.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
How did you know?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
I'll take a bus.
I'll take you... why not?
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Hello.
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
That seems like a good choice.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Cute.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
Okay to say something now?
Go ahead.
I should've danced with you.
Okay. Good-bye.
Were you asleep?
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Grouchy?
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
What job?
Were you asleep?
What are you doing here?
I wasn't asleep!!
What a break...
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Because...
Boyfriend?
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
You know what? I...
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Yes. I really would.
Well...
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
What a nice compliment.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
No!!!
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
How to die, mostly.
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
Good night.
I've got to sketch you.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
All right, cut me a break.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
I'll take care of myself --
One night with me!
You think you're kidding.
You lost me.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
What point is that?
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Sounds risky to me.
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
I love you...  Let him take you home.
Don't want to. I love you.
No. No. Get Carol.
What are you trying to do to me?
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
Help!
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as obsessive compulsive disorder and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
You changed the room around...
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
So am I, Frank.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say no to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying no.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Thanks for looking after him.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
How's Verdell doing?
He's a pain in the ass.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Okay by me.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Do it.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
What? Look at you... You sense a mark.
Hey -- you called me... I...
About a dog.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Think white and get serious.
This is Cheeba.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Last word freak.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
What?
Wait here.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
No. Please, don't force him.
Sorry. What are those cards?
Well, I can't reach them.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
You okay?
Is he dead yet?
Absolutely.
Sure thing.
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City Sailor want to hump-hump bar? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Ask him.
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
What's he look like?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Which color was that?
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
How're you doing?
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
'Love was... '
Yeeeess!!!
Maybe this can wait.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Did you... do something to him?
Do you realize that I work at him?
No, I didn't.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Okay, then.
What is your problem?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Verdell?
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Get out.
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Get out.
Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me...  it's not affection. It's a trick.
Now we'll both call him.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
I brought you Chinese soup.
Thanks.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Got any easier questions?
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Yeah...
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
That's very thoughtful.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
You consider your life easy.
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I'm going back with you.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Does it matter?
I told you to go on in.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
I think you gotta camp it here...
What are you talking about?
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I love you.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
You going to come talk to me or not?
I'm coming.
I'm a great guy -- extraordinary...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Because...  ... you love her?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Okay... you tell me why --  You're dying here.
Did you like it that much?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Picking on me won't help.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
I forgot to lock the door.
What's it mean?
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, hold that pose. Then just try and comfortably hold it.
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Which one is your brother?
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Just a second -- he has to go.
Why are you doing this?
You've said that already.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
Just want to say good luck.
Break a leg.
Your life will never be the same.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
We both lied to him.
What do you want me to say?
Just don't lie to me.
Same here.
The pleasure is mine.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
Everybody shut up.
What is this?
A gift.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Thanks.
I thought it was appropiate.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
Why'd you do that?
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Do you have to be so damn forthright?
Light?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
This is crazy.
That's why it will be so much fun.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Work related or otherwise?
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
Don't make me have to use this.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Give me the gun.
Yes, your name?
Hi, Mona.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
Can I kiss you too?
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Same thing Giuliani said.
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
In time.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
What you did is dead wrong.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I don't believe it.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
It looks delicious.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
How's the food?
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Peerless, your father called.
I'll be right over.
He wants you to come and see him.
He said that?
Yes he did.
Where is he?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Regardless, he still is your father.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
No.
Not at all?
You know how your Daddy is.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Soon.
Where are you from?
Finland.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
How did you get this gig?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
Let Myrna finish.
Yes you!
You've never had any formal training, either?
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
What do you mean?
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, it's all about the Benjamins.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
To come back to our roots.
No mo' city slickers.  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
She hates dem.
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
I thought you got rid of...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
I heard ya lady is wild.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
...not that time...
Around...
...then what about...
...perfect...
...like macaroni and cheese...
...like fried and chicken...
I fell out of my bed last night.
I slept too near where I fell out.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
I feel a song a comin' on.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
A lot?
Enough.
So what's up with you?
What do you want to know?
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
What else?
Are you trying to rap to me?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
No, before my time.
You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
We can look out for ourselves.
Why don't you call him?
You're sure this is a good idea.
My people love me.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
What?
You look beautiful like that.
How did you get this gig?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
You leave something out?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
And?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like IHOP.  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Then what?
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
The deuce you say.  That crate!
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
You okay?
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Let her out. In my custody.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
It?  Who does?
What is it, Tommy?
Dead.  Damnit!
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
The door's locked.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Now!
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
What? How do you know that?
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
Don't shoot!
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
Got a casualty list?
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
This is so embarrassing...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Did you say...Peggy?
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Everybody okay up here?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Go away.  Let me rot?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Pretty terrible shot.
Was she pretty?
Who?
The girl I remind you of.
It's kinda hard this way.
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Which?  The one in my throat.
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Another 'you'?
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
You keep an eye on it.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
She was killed, Penny.
Oh, my.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
How did she die?  I wanna know.
You don't wanna know.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
Never.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
It's too dangerous.
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
Stay here, I'll be back.
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
What's his problem?
Better than him.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Yeeees?
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
There aren't hotels?
And what did you say?
I said I'd check with you.
Do we know anything about him?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
It's the last thing we need.
Scottish.
Tom Jones?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Did you really ask?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
It isn't working any more, David.
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
Jesus.
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
Go ahead.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
There were three strawberries.
One.
Liar.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
Ali?  What's wrong?
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
David, I'm serious!
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Hi,
Hi.....  Roses.
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Sort of half.....
Meaning?
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
0 my god.
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
Let's get a coffee.
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
Everything's gonna be fine.
About Charles...
shhh...
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
Here, let me do that.
No, I'm fine.
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Annie, it's me.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Right first time.
Thanks, Annie.
Goodnight Annie.
Uh ... yes ...
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
What?  What?
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
It's very good Bernie.
She's ... well, she's good.
Yes, isn't he.
Isn't it?
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
David?
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Right.  Got it.
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?  Well, the truth is - we can't.  So what am I saying?  Will we find her again?  Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.
Say that again, son.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
You're not going to ....
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
No!
Er ... pray tell me why?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Ahm....
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Quite right, sir.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
Certainly is.
David, David, David ...
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Of course.
And a car.
Mmmmm...
Maybe two cars.
A car sounds sensible.
What makes you say that?
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Sean Connery.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
Sure.  You're right.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
You arrange those flowers yourself?
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Great, good.
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
How the hell should I know?
Not at all, Governor.  Very striking.
Why thank you sir.
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
I am sorry you feel that way.
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
What's gone?
The TV.
What?
This sucks.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.

No it wasn't!
Uh,...Oh yeah.
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
What's your problem Beavis?
I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Beavis, this is the greatest day of our lives. Huh huh huh.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.

And Boot-Head.
Yeah, we should party.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Ow! These chips suck.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Uh... Uh...
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Me first?
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Me first! Me first!
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Me first!
Forget it, bunghole!
Huh huh huh.
Me first.
Huh huh. No way, dude.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Heh heh. Thank God.
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
Cut it out butt-hole!
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Damn, huh huh.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
So, like, where is she?
Yeah, really.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Cool! Huh huh huh.
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
My butt's bothering me!
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Uh...
That was boring. Huh huh.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Uh... We can't leave Washington 'till we find that chick.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
Uh... Is this the right bus?
You mean there's mre than one?
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Cool, huh huh.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Uh... I think you scared them off.
This sucks. What are we doing here? Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and score or something?
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Whoa, my life is cool!
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Huh? Huh huh.
Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like, everything looks all weird and...
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Uh, you first.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Well where is she?!
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
What's your problem Beavis?
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!
Uh... bye-bye.
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Turd-burglar...
Dill-wad...
Bunghole...
Butt-snatch...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Um... ass... head...
Uh... butt-snatch...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Beavis.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Really? I poop too much.
Heh heh, thanks.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Uh, we didn't score yet.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
...Two...
Thrr...
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
Talk ta me, Bork.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Ah, the witness?
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
You see what I see, Bork?
I see it. I don't get it.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Cut the power!
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Deep and hard.
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
That's better. Yes?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Where did these guys come from?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
D.C., Chief.
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Agent Hurley...
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Where are his pants?
Who knows?
Uh, Butt-Head.
Do her? Huh huh.
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Cool. Huh huh huh.
Cool, huh huh huh.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Really? That's where we're from.
You scored with two chicks?!
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
No, Jane.
We're rich in what really matters.
I will never sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
She's ready.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Almost.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
Oh no.
It's your turn, darling.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
Wave at the lion.
Adam!
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Oh... I'm sorry...
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
How's your arm?
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
You'd better sit down, hon.
I am sitting.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
Two hours.
What?
That's how long you were gone.
... Hmmm?
Anything happen while I was away?
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
Deceased.  I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
I don't think we survived the crash.
This is going to take some time.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to last?
Cabin fever, hon?
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Maybe this is heaven.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around people, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
What's she doing here?
I don't know.  Jane, Jane, up here!
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Won't?  Or can't?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
That's my girl!
Adam, we are in hell.  I hate these people.
They make gypsies look good.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
I know.  I'm sorry.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
That little girl saw us.
She couldn't have.  We can't make them see us.
But she saw us.  I could feel it.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
What about this Beetle guy?
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Wait.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
My God, we're back where we started.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really moan!  Practice, practice, practice.
I feel really stupid.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Where are your skulls and bones?
You know you're really a pretty girl.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
She's got photos, Barbara.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Of course I did.
Then it should be here.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
Betelgeuse!
Three times.  Powerful number.
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The juice of beetles.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
I guess we open it.
Maybe we should knock first?
She's only fourteen...
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
But we let him out.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel really confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
And your sushi was remarkable.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
Who did the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
Adam!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
I didn't --
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Little black party dresses?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Let's see if she can get my model back.
You can build another one... with her.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to things.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
Just a hunch.
What time is it?
3:30 I guess.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
All right.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
We're ghosts.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are sheets.  Are you gross under there?  Are you Night of the Living Dead under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
What?
Night of the Living Dead?  It's this gross movie.
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Is this like a trick question?
Nobody else can.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
We were trying to scare your mother.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
You did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't you leave?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
What is going on?
Did you get the paint?
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
I got an A!
So can I?
Oh puh-leeze!
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Help vouchers?
Wait for who?
Aren't you dead?
You don't kill anyone.
But... the Deetzes are destroying our house.
Can you scare them off?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
This is my town.
Barbara?!!
We tried.
And if we need you again, how do we...?
Handbook?  When...?
Out.
Just get some people out of our house.
Just one daughter.
Home.  Home.  Home!
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Are you Juno, our case worker?
We need help.  We deserve help.
We're very unhappy.
Yes.
No.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Our cemetery?
About what?
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
Tell the truth.
Funeral.  God, you guys really are dead!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
I don't wear that stuff to bed. Besides, there's nothing wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
No, wait!
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
I want to be dead too.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Life is just... too awful.
So, never let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Step... mother.
How'd you do on the science test?
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
And live in what, our station wagon?
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Are you a spirit too?
I want to get in.
I think so.
Yeah.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Yes.
Three syllables.
Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
I am not!  Beetle... Juice?
Your name is Beetle Juice?  Yecch! That's as bad as Deeelia Deeetz.
God, you're anatomically correct!
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
You've got to help them.
... I will.
W... What is it?
Your qu...?  But you're...
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking from the ground ups'ville!
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
He's your cousin.
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
Otho?
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
It's Otho!
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
Lydia, at your age, you are so young.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Just don't tell Lydia.
Why not?
I think she's in with them.
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
What do you think, honey?
Delia hates it.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be filled with people like us.
Where is your mother?
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Let me have it.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Stepmother.
... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.
What?
I'm lonely.
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Stepmother's...
... sheets.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
This is not a joke!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
Look at all that parking!
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I cannot believe this.
Delia will cook...
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
I can't bring the ghosts.  They're not here!
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
They're... not here anymore.
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could run it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Otho, can you do it?
Are they suffering?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
We'll be the art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
You jerks!  That is my art, and it is dangerous!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  Ghosts.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for Architectural Digest.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in Vanity Fair.  Except you.
I told them you were too mean to be afraid.
Don't you dare talk to others about me.  I'm an artist!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
Don't you dare.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
It wasn't a joke.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
I'm sorry already.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
I'm so glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
What's wrong?
I thought I saw something.
Okay?
I know... I read your book, The Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.
Gooood!
What do you think?
Viridian?
Of course, her favorite color! How beautiful!
I know!  We just have to pray that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Otho, I cannot live with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Is there much more of this torture?
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place might just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
You don't have a key?
Maybe Charles does.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Probably the world's largest Reader's Digest collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
No!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, nurture them.
Look at the tiny figures.
Are they still here, Otho?
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
What's happening to them?
I don't know.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
Is this the key to the attic?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
They don't want to come down.
Why not?
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
The attic.
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
Their wedding clothes.
Adam!  Adam!
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
But not for long...
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
Yes. I think so, too.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
I see.
Oh, fine.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
An attorney?
Yes.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Thank you.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
No.
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
... And please call me Robert.
Yes, Robert. I will.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
It's fine today, Robert.
Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
... Were you going somewhere?
No, Robert.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
He does, does he?
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
Thank you, Robert.
I would like to walk today.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Oh, really?
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
In a day or two, yes.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
No more, Robert... No more needles...
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
No, Eve... I'm sorry.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... But he's...?
... He walked off...
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
... Do you think we should look for him?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I wish he were here...
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
I have no idea...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Certainly, glad to be of help.
Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Do you know Raphael?
A Black man gave me the message.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Thank you.
Oh, yes.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
No. I like this attic very much.
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
I hope you're comfortable.
Yes. I am.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
Would you care for a drink?
Yes. Thank you.
I would like to watch television.
Oh? Certainly...
Hello, Eve.
May I ask your name?
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I'm a gardener.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Did you lose something?
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Yes.
I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
No. It won't do that.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
No. I like it here.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
... Why... No, I don't think so...
That's good.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Good night, Eve.
Chauncey!
Hello, Eve.
Your leg must be getting better.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Fine. He's very nice.
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Yes.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
... Mentor...?
Yes. I was.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
What is that?
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
Chauncey...
Hello, Eve.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Thank you, Eve.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
... Good night, Chauncey.
Good night, Eve.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
Yes. That could be true.
... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
Thank you, Eve.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
Hello, Dennis.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
Thank you.
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
I like to watch.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
That's very interesting, Eve.
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Hello, Eve.
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I have nothing more to say.
I see.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
I see.
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
I agree.
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Yes, I understand.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
So you know Krylov!
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Oh, good.
Yes, it is very good!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Thank you.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
... I see.
I feel very good in here.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Yes. You look very sick.
I agree.
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
And I'm Ben.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
No, Ben.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
I understand.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
Yes. That is correct.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Thank you, Ben.
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Certainly, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Oh, I see.
A flower...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Yes. I would like to do that.
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
I like to watch.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
I want to tell Eve.
Yes.
Hello, Ronald.
I can't write.
I can't read.
Yes. I like to watch.
What sort of bed is it?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Oh. Thank you.
Yes. Of men and women.
No.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
Good day, Sally.
It's very sore.
I agree.
Of course. I would like to look.
Yes.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
... Yes. You can take me.
... My suitcase.
Does it have a television?
I see.
... That is a very small room.
Yes. It seems to be.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... Good evening, Louise.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
I see.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Is his back feeling better?
Good morning, Louise.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Yes. I've seen that done.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Yes. It is.
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
I'm going to work in the garden.
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
Yes.
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
Yes.
You're welcome.
Yes. That is surprising.
I hope so.
No. I don't object.
Which view?
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Thank you.
I am a very serious gardener.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
I see...
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Compensated...?
I was given meals, and a home...
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
No, I do not have any of those.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
1952...?
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Have you served in the Army?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
Yes, I understand.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
But you won't sign, correct?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
Good morning, Mr. President.
... Hello.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
... Oh, really...
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Yes, I will.
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
... In the garden?
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. It has.
Yes. I will.
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
No headaches?
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Do you feel well enough for that?
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
That's good... That's good.
... Ben, really...
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Good evening, Wilson.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
... How are the kids getting along?
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
No, that won't do any good.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
It's not that, I just...
I can certainly understand that...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
... What do you make of all this?
... Yeah...
It's that gardener!
No! He's a real gardener!
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Look, Johanna...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
No problem, Chief.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
Right, Chief.
This is not what I requested.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Right, Chief.
So...? Where the hell is it?
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Yes, sir.
... So what does all that add up to?
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
I would appreciate that.
Oh? What?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Good. Anything else?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
That could be possible...
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Thank you, Colonel.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
Yes, I did.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Well, Ben... I...
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
It's that serious, huh?
I'm afraid so.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
You take care too, Bobby.
This is my fiancee Maxine.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
Malkovich.
Thank you.
I never played a jewel thief.
I don't know.
Yeah, okay.
Please, have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Tell your friends.
Morning.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Enjoy.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
What?
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Which one is Elijah again?
The monkey.
Is the trial date set?
May 11th.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
I'm a puppeteer.
Why, Craig. why?
I... puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Seven-ish
We have to make it an early night.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Hmmm.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Hmmm.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
She's very beautiful.
Just an idea I had.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. WeÃ†re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I was worried.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The ferret?
Right.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Yeah. You want a beer?
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
What?
Now?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I'm scared.
I have to go back.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
We'll talk about it in the car.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
Why aren't you at work?
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
How was it?
Why?
Don't crowd me, Craig.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
No they're not.
You've always hated the animals.
You've always loved the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
What's that?
Us, of course.
What about Maxine?
Fuck Maxine.
Yes.
And he was with her.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
We?
Me and John.
Don't forget me.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Suck my dick!
Tell her you need to see her.
You bastard.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
What's that?
I'm a puppeteer.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I need a shower.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I love you so much.
My God!
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
The monkey.
A better friend.
I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
People make mistakes.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
Maxine...
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
Simulates?
Let me try.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
Let me try!
So how was it?
That... was... no... simulation.
I know. I'm sorry...
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Schwartz.
Schwartz.
My name is Schwartz.
Forget it.
Yes?
I am a trained performer.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid IÃ†m in love with somebody else.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Security.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, I can't understand a word any of you are saying.
No.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ã´Ladies,Ã¶ I begin. Ã´I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Yessir.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Dr. Lester. . .
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Thank you, sir.
Dr. Lester...
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
You're insane.
Moving story.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Is that true?
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.

I wouldn't know.
Yes, well...
No, really.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
What?
I just wanted to say Ã´hi.Ã¶  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Yeah.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Why not?
Who told you?
Who told you?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Somebody told you.
Maxine.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Just.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You married?
Yeah. But enough about me.
What'll you have?
The usual, Barry.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
My tits?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
That's the usual?
IÃ†m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
Hi.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Yikes.
Please, let me explain.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
No.
This is important!
It better be.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
What's he been in?
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Sure. It'd be fun.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
My God.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
You're evil, Maxine.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
You're glowing again.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Lotte, this is so good...
Lotte? Is that you?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Let him try.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Hush, sweetheart.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
No.
No. Don't be an ass.
You can be John Malkovich.
Two hundred dollars, please.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
A scary dream?
I like that.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
What kind of circumstances?
The Great Mantini?
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do Tru with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Forget it.
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Good morning, Lotte!
Do you?
Says who?
Do you?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
But of course.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
I'm getting divorced.
No you mustn't, my child.
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No.
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Why not? I need to get in there!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Yes, Hi.
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Let her go, Craig. I mean Ã´him."
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Ah.
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
Yes?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
I love you, Lotte.
Maxine...
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
I have to see you.
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
We have to meet.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Did you see the reviews?
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
She's not available.
How do we do that?
What's the play?
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of Long Day's Journey Into Night.
Who needs dancing?
Yeah?
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
How'd you get this number?
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Whatever you're having.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
I'm sorry, did you just call me Lotte?
Do you mind?
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Oh, Lotte...
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
Darling!
What the fuck is going on?
Come on in.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Lotte called me.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'm getting better all the time.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
You still there, sweets?
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
You mean with Malkovich?
I'd love to see your work.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Stay in him forever?
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
It's okay, my sweet.
Vegas.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
He's a selfish bastard.
They love me, darling! Craig Schwartz is fantastic!  The New York Times. If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!  Women's Wear Daily. Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Sleepy suddenly.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Bad dream, darling?
I've got to leave Malkovich.
You've got to be kidding.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Yeah what?!
Good-bye, Maxine.
Whatever.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah, okay.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
It's the LeBaron.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Huh.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Well Dude, we just don't know.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Oh, nothin', you know.
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Her life is in your hands.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Shit.
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
Where'd she been?
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
But I guess she told Dieter.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
Uh-huh.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The?  Who the fff--
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yeah, it sucks.
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
Fuck you.
Come and get it.
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
ANTI-SEMITE!
Can we just rent it from you?
Yeah.
Where've you been?
What's this?
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Yeah, but we're--
What the fuck is he talking about?
My rug.
Fuckin' A.
And this guy peed on it.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
What do you mean, Dude?
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Yeah.
I am the Walrus.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Sheesh.
Where you going, Dude?
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Thank you, Donny.
Almost five!
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
What--
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
I was bowling--
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
What's a pederast, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
If what's during league play?
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
I am the Walrus.
That fucking bitch!
What the fuck is he talking about?
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
Burkhalter.
It's already posted.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
I'm shomer shabbas.
What's that, Walter?
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
Kill that poor woman.
Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
Where's your car, Dude?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Uh-huh.
Are you gonna split hairs?
Am I wrong?
Well--
What do you need that for, Dude?
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Those are good burgers, Walter.
What have you.  We'll, uh--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Yes, uh, very impressive.
I'm not really, uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Lebowski on the right?
He's handicapped, huh?
Far out.
Nancy's pretty good.
Are these.
Different mothers, huh?
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
I see.
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
I'm unemployed.
...Also, my rug was stolen.
No.  Here.
And the, uh, the briefcase?
Ahh, not so good, man.
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Mm.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude abides.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Which one was Logjammin'?
On you, maybe.
I thought you might know, man.
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Huh?
Yeah man.
Is that what that's a picture of?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Oh yeah?
Johnson?
Thank you.
Huh?
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Excuse me?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
You're not interested in sex?
You mean coitus?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Oh, no.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
He fixes the cable?
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this abduction, but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
Yeah, but my-
Well--sure, I could do that--
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
A hundred.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Yeah, but what about--
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
That's really thoughtful but I--
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
She most certainly was not!
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
And please don't call her my mother.
Now I got--
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
The main guy, Dieter--
Her co-star in the beaver picture?
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Well...yeah--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
So Dieter has the money?
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Delayed after-eff--
I want you to see him immediately.
Maude?
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Uh-huh.
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Mmnun.
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Uh-huh.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
What do you do for fun?
Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. Drive around.  The occasional acid flashback.
What happened to your house?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Finder's fee?
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Jeffrey--
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
But he's--
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Increases?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
I want a child.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
So...that doctor.
What?
This was, uh--
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
This was a valued, uh.
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
What the fuck are you--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
So who--
No, but--
Yeah, but--
Okay. That, uh.
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Theodore Herzel.
Huh?
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
What do you mean brought it bowling? I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not buying it a fucking beer.  He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Hey man--
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Hey Walter--
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
MARK IT ZERO!
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Am I wrong!
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Well, just take 't easy, man.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Huh?
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
Huh.
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Just for making the hand-off?
Yeah.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
What if it's during a game?
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
Huh?
That...fucking...bitch!
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Have it your way.  The point is--
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
It's your roll.
What the hell is this?
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
Oh shit.  Walter.
What the fuck is going on there?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Easy, Dude.
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
...Huh?
FUCK.
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Huh?
We throw the money out of the moving car!
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
Wooden bridge, huh?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's the bridge--
Walter!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
What the fuck?
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Walter--
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
That's it.  I'm out of here.
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
Yeah yeah, kill that poor woman.
Walter--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Our car, Walter?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Aw, fuck it.
That wasn't her toe.
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
The nail polish, Walter.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
But Walter--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
What about the toe?
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Thanks Walter.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Dude--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Now Dude--
They're nihilists.
Huh?
Yeah.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
No, I'm--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
Who the fuck is that?
Huh?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Yeah.
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh-huh.
The bulk of the series.
Uh-huh.
No.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Uh.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
Is the car out front yours?
We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
And the fucking money!
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Huh?
It is a fucking emergency.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
What's your point, Dude?
Yeah?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
You know this!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
This driveway.
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
He can't walk, Walter!
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
Walter, you fuck!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Yeah.
That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
What's mine is mine.
Come on, Walter!.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
They shot Donny!
There weren't any shots.
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Wha.
Call the medics, Dude.
Wha. . . Donny--
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Well can we--
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Walter--
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Dude, I'm sorry--
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Shit!
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
Friends like these, huh Gary.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Is this a--what day is this?
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Ah fuck it.
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
Dude.
Huh?
I don't know, sir.
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
Mind if I smoke a jay?
Bunny.
'Scuse me?
Fuckin' A.
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well we--I don't--
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
WHAT?!
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
Where's the money, Lebowski?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Well. . . yeah.
All right, get out.  Both of you.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Walter!
You monsters!
Help me put him back in his chair.
Who the hell is he?
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
I said out.  Now.
Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker.
Stay away from me, mister!
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Shit, sorry man.
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Smokey Huh?
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
Am I wrong!?
A world of pain.
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
This is a league game, Smokey!
Shit, shit, shit...
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
Yeah.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
You write this?
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
Nice, Jane.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
What did I do to you?
How you doing?
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Keep it to yourself.
Oh, stop it.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
You have the job you have...
Shut up a second...
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Okay.
Yes.
There are only ten.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Fifty, right?
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
What's wrong with it?
Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
What?
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
I don't like being handled.
Sit on it!  Now look.
Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
It's not loaded.
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
No.  No.
No?
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
Oh, God, no!
And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
You were smokin' toward the end there.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
No.  Don't worry about it.
I'll put her on.
What did they do with you?
They booted me out of Washington.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Why?  What did they do to you?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.  That's a promotion!
I don't think so.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
You know what I...
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Hi.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
He excels at gratitude.
Are you any closer to a decision?
It's nice to see you.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
Why?
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
That's your full name?
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Which would you prefer?
Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it, Ellen.  Let's call security and get him out.
Hi.  Turn on your TV... Good Morning America, the Morning News and Today are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
A half hour in the lobby.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [sic].
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Let me see what I can do.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Why do you say that?
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
Sure.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Good night.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Call if you get weird.
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the Times and he had a great audition tape.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
Nine seconds.
Eleven and a half.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
Did you shoot their boots?
Of course.
We can cut back at the end.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
I write for you sometimes.
Not because you have to.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Watch? --
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Yes.
Good.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
I didn't know you were going with him.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
As good as humanly possible.
Yes.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Okay, great -- good luck.
You too.
How'd it go?
No.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
Do others feel that you did well?
No.
Then what was good about it?
Aaron, will you tell me?
People phoned in.
I'm not kidding.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
No!!!!!
This is important to me.
Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
What?
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
How?
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Sit down, stop.
Don't say anything about anything.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Speaking.
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
Let's go...
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Yes.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
Really?
I'm going to take it.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Well -- my wife got this new job...
Ready.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
I'm gonna go look at it again.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
You didn't say anything to her?
That's it.  I resign as of now.
Stop it.
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Outside?
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Wipe me out?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Upper management thinks you're dull.
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
So I quit.
Just a few questions?
We came from Washington.
It depends on how big a news day it is.
What is she shooting?
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a Homecoming  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Yes.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
Yes, there is.
I'll never tell.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
It's started.
Play back the last line...
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Just a two-second dissolve.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Bobbie, please.
No, I don't think so.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Yes.  That's right.
No...no.
What?
Yes.  How do you know?
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Nobody else had it.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
Oh.
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
I'll speak to you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
They fired me.
Bye, sweetie.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
No.  Not even you.
I don't know.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- Beat them off with a stick.
It's not.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
It's not opinion.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Hi.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
I was a lot earlier.
I like godsend.
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.
If we could just eat first.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as White House sources say...
That actually goes on...
Yes, sure.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
So great -- right?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
How are you at back rubs?
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I trust you.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
I don't write.
One year...almost one year.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
Uh-huh.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
Whoa, this was a mistake.
Hey?
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.
They said it would be okay if...
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
How's it going?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Okay.
So he was indicted?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
I've got another story.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Billion.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
What do you mean clean?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
You okay?
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Excited.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Yeah?
I'll wait for you till seven.
Okay.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
I'll be the judge of that.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
What?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Well, what is it?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Yes.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
It's not important.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Why, you need me for the story?
No.  Were you going to you?
Uh-huh.
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
Oh, good.
We can go together.
So you like me, huh?
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
So what did you think?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
It's incredible who's here.
Who?
Me!
Good.  That's it...See you.
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
You okay?
Great.
Why can't I let go of this woman?
Well...
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
This is hysterical.
Because you're nuts.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
What?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
Hi.  It's me.
Where are you?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Well, when?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Uh-huh.
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Hello?
Yes.
Okay.  Good night.
Good night??!
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
That's yes?
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Why?
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
I got promoted for things like that.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
It just proves that the difference we have are...
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
I don't wan to discuss work.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
I knew what you meant.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
It's okay.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
You want to come?
Then you should stay here.
Take it easy.
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Go ahead -- what?
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
I can't be.
Right back to you.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
Where's the bathroom?
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
That's enough.  That's enough.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
Don't you work here?
Would you like to do me?
I just might.
I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
Oh yeah?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
I didn't finish talking to you!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Tonight.
What, right now?
Uh-huh.
It's kind of dark -
Shh!
I'm almost ready -
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Oh it's enough...
Are you nervous, Walter?
Not even a little bit?
I already told you I'm not.
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
A girl with a body like mine?
You're breaking my concentration!
Walter can I ask you something?
What!
Are you a virgin?
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Anything new?
Is the manager cooperating?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
What the hell's going on?
What did he do?
See you later -
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
Honest?
You really like it?
Great!  What is it?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Let's see it.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Now you're a professional!
Hi Walter.
What's up, Walter?
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
Is it murdered man?
Better!
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
More champagne, your majesty?
Here here...
Where where...
May I please have another little kiss?
Sorry...
Did you hear what he said?
Yes Walter.
All about me...
It's true, isn't it?
Every word...
I know what it is to be ignored.
I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...
I mean, you look so pretty.
Thank you.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Goodbye.
Bye!
Hm...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
You think I'm creative?
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
Carla -
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
What are you trying to say?
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Walter, I'm sorry...
You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
No! I want to talk about it now!
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Forget it.
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
What?
There's...a body inside that statue!
Walter...stay away from me!
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Here you go, enjoy.
It was.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Walter...I can't believe it.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Hi Walter...
What are you doing here so early?
Maybe so...
I wouldn't give up your day job.
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Leonard, what are you doing?
Are you trying to be funny?
I'm totally serious!
Murdered...man?...
Are you alright?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
What's the matter with you?
Nothing...nothing at all.
Don't ask.
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
I admit it.
Why not?
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
Would you pose for me for free?
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
What is it, your laundry?
Huh?
Where'd ya buy that?
I didn't buy it I made it.
You...made that?
I said I did, didn't I!
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
Well it sure looks dead enough.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
I didn't mean to.
Got carried away, huh?
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Sure!
People seem to like my cat.
Enough already about it - get to work!
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Well I don't know -
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Well...
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
A parakeet?
Go home.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Good night Walter.
H-have a seat?
Have a seat -
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
They are?
Hiya Carla.
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
You know what that proves?
What, Mr. De Santis?
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
I-I already got a new one!
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
You didn't mean to what?
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
It's hot in here...
You want me to open a window or something?
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
A show..how soon can we go?
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
You better hold off on the bubbly.
Yeah, why?
You might talk too much.
Yeah and what would I say?
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
It was.
What do you have in the box?
Just wait till you see this!
Whatsamatter Leonard?
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Put it down, Walter.
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Well, w-what did you do?
Never mind...
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
Yeah?
Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...
Excuse me I have to make a call...
No...look I'm busy...
Can't you see I'm busy here?
How ya doin'?
Hello, Walter.
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Uh, sure.
Hm.
Yeah I did.
I also saw the girl give you this.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
You can cut the crap.
Police officer.
You're like an undercover guy!
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
C-connection?
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Telling you what?
Smack?
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
You are?
I- don't know what you're talking about!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
I ain't going no place with you!
You're gonna shoot me!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Relax!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Walter shut up and relax!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska.
Are you done with these?
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Maxwell.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Hiya Maxwell.
I thought you didn't respect money!
What do you get?
Hello Mayolia.
With Dead Cat?
Really?
I can't.  I gotta go home.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
I don't think so Mayolia.
You don't have to do anything!
Gee.  Thanks.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Oh, OK.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
T-tell him that?
OK Mrs. Swicker.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
I was just straightening up the place.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Well, um... litter?
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Nice to feel needed.
Yes!
Andy!
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Don't grab me, okay?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Suck!
Wrong answer!  No prize.
No, we didn't.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
It's coffee.
Amazing!
Figures.
You're the guys from the movie!
We hate you guys!
Bummer metaphor.
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
You didn't like them.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
You think?  Split?
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Let me in.
Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
I'm fine.
I... feel.... pretty.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
I mean it.
Did you see a girl come by here?
Yes.
Which way did she go?
What's playing there?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Don't tread on the earth?
Dying.
Hi, guys.
Uum... around ten?
Yeah?
Maybe.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
You okay?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Something like that.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
What show is this?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Mmmnkay.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
You were having a nightmare.
What'd you dream about?
Nothing.
Come on, what was it?
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Hey there.
Hi.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Jealous?
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I do?  I guess I do.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
'Bye.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
I thought we were meeting here.
I'm here with Jenny.
I don't understand.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
No, you didn't.  When?
Didn't you get my message?
You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home.  Like always.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
I think you've forgotten something.
No...
It could happen.
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
You guys are thrashed.
Buffy.
Hi.
Hi there.
How are you doing?
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
You want some water or something?
Water.  Okay.
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Not exactly.
They were vampires, weren't they?
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Well, stay here tonight.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Where are you gonna go?
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
Things are kind of confusing.
I'll back that up.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
You sure?
Mmkay.
Hey, Buffy...
Yeah?
You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
I didn't expect to see you.
I know.
Why'd you come back?
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Thanks.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Who?
Merrick...
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
A dress.
Dress, huh?  What for?
Come again?
I'm going to the senior dance.
Second word... sound like 'dance'.
What for?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
He did what he was supposed to.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I should have known.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
I crashed your party.
Pretty shallow of you.
That's me.
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
I'm going out the front.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Are you okay?
Get away from me!
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Bugs.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
) What do you think?
Please.  It's so '91.
What are we doing?
Well, where?
Beverly Center.
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Where?
Cafe Blase.
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Get a boob job.
I forgot.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Oh my God you're having an affair.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
Get out of my facial.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
Am I in trouble or something?
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
What are you talking about?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Why?
To bring you... your birthright.
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Time to do what?
Yes.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Just stay away from me, okay?
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
Everybody does.
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
I was a slave.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
China.
Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
Lothos.
How do you know all this?
I have to show you.
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Ow.
Cramps?
This is it.
Wait a minute.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
She --
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
All right.
Meet me at this address after school.
I have cheerleading squad.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
It's true.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
Our purposes.
What, um...  What do we do?
Why do you keep saying that?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Oh, him.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
What?
We'll cover it later.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Uh... gym.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Sporting events, yeah.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Okay.
Who we gonna beat?
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
Oh.  Good.
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
I had to test you.
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
It was necessary.
I don't think you understand the full implications of --
Oh.  Sorry.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Put your head back.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
Your turn.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
My nails.
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
They were vampires?
Same one.
Oh.
Try to pay attention.
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Fine.
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
You are such a wet.
A what?
Don't start with me again.
Buffy...
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Oh, fuck you!
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
I...
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
Five?
Five.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Not if you're careful.
How can you keep doing this?
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Watchers?
It isn't important.
I'm curious, is all.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
As for example, what?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Vampires of the world, beware.
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
I can't work this.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
I want to die.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Interesting.
There isn't time.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
All right.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Football is my life.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
And where are they now?
He knows who I am!
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
No THX.
They don't even have Dolby.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
That's the plan.
Good enough!
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
Come one, that was so weird.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
That is so cool.
Thank you very much.
I don't get it.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
B'bye.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Thanks.
You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
Sorry.
Pike.
You're having a fling with him?
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Later for it.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Oh.
Write that down.
Oh, baby!
Buffy?
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
I heard she got straight A's.
I can't believe they still ate it.
Throw it out.
Okay.
Buffy?
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Buffy!
Cool!
Wit-tay.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Hey, wait a minute...
They'll kill us!
You want some punch?
He is so bald.
Like we don't have rights too?
The homelesses?
Okay.
Oh, yeah!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Well, look who's here.
Smell of booze much.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
What are you talking about?
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
Oh, thank you very much.
Like you've got a grip.
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
So, we're stupid now?
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Right.
And the January Semi-formal --
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
I don't think so.
I am.
You said Crash.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
You said Crash.
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
Yeah maybe you're right.
You can learn to like it.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
God, I never thought of that.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
What?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
What is this I
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Catch?
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Which nostril am I breathing through?
My right nostril?
There are two important psychic conduits called the pingala and the ida.  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
How was that?
A little better.
Gimme the God damn ball!
How ya like that?
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Death is like spring training?
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Nuke?!
No.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--
No, no, it was great.
How 'bout a back rub?
I'll tuck you in.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
That's my leg.
I know what it is.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
Fundamentals?
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
Yes I do...
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
What a nasty thing to say.
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
I'm trying to play with your body!
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
I did.
What'd he say?
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
He did?
I'll be back when we lose.
We lost.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
--but you're father's in there!
It's Skip, for you.
That's great!
How can I possibly thank you?
Well I guess this is it.
Neither will I.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
You didn't get lured.  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions.
That's better.  Got the radar ready?
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
We all deserve to wear white.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
I don't dance.
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'll learn.  C'mon--
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
What do you believe in?
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the sweet spot, voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
G'night.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
I'm not interested yet.
See my hips?
Yep.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
So...Wanta make love?
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not dim.  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him life-wisdom and help him make it to the major leagues.
Damn.
You're pulling your hips out.
But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
Don't tell anybody.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Let me.
Your place or mine?
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
You got me all confused.
I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
Crash...I want you.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
He' s confused--
Aren't we all?
Don't you think I'm pretty?
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
I want to be had.
I think of you and the boy all the time.
He won't make love to me anymore.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I want you desperately!
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
And now you wanta teach me?
I doubt that.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an uncomplicated boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
You okay?
Why baseball?
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Who?
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
What's so great about baseball?
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
I don't know if I'd go that far.
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
It's possible.
No.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
Why not?
I got released.
I heard already.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
What happened?
I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-non-time kind of time to it...
Annie---
What?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
He looks great, just great!
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
Oh dear....easy honey...
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
He's a good student.
Praise the Lord, eh?
Oh let's not...
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You got a live arm there.
You need a nickname.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being re-channeled but I believe in re-channeling so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
Oh both of you, of course...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Good--then listen.  I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--
God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
It was a cocksucking call!
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Beg me!
Beg me again!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh.
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Don't think.
Why you shaking me off?
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
To announce your fucking presence with authority?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
Well, I held it like an egg.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
He did know.
How?
I told him.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
Gimme that.
How come you don't like me?
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
What do I got?
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You been in the Majors?
Yep.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me Meat!  You wanta step outside!
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
Naw...
Naw?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Go for it.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
I won't have to.
Party without me.
God--what a Big League move.
What?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I was playing naked.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Annie's a smart lady.
I was great, eh?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
You're the boss.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
What do I gotta do?
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Write this down.  We gotta play 'em one day at a time.
Boring.
Of course.  That's the point.  I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub.
Write, write--I just wanta give It my best shot and
...Good Lord willing, things'll work out.
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
What's wrong?
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
I'm going to the Show.
Then go.
I'm trying to thank you.
Let go of me!
C ' mon!
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
You fuck!
Why am I a fuck?
You're a great catcher.
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
My right.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
What?
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
Sorry about last night.
Forget it.
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
Nuke--  Good luck.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in A ball?
And where can I go?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Love to--
Take the first shot at me.
Hit me in the chest with this...
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
I gotta go now, Dad.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
Ain't he warning up?
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
It's a league record.
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
We're eight and sixteen.
It's a miracle.
What for?
No I don't.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
...and one helluva guy.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
It's a damn convention.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Looking for Crash Davis.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Where does he go?
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
I paid for those guitar cases.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
It's enough isn't it?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Yes.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
It is. I did it cooking.
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Name it.
What are you doing here?
Leave him!
No I haven't.
Right.
Uh... Yes.
Hello.
Right.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
What are you doing here?
Sorry. You've lost me...
I'm asking what you're here for.
What?
What did he say?
He says he feels safe here.
I need to know who you are first please.
Oh.  We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
So?
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
What was that?
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
So how long will you be in England?
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
No, no...
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
She says she has a secret to tell.
What?
When?
I...
I have these uh... She explains to you... When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses. Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Binoculars.
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
What was that?
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
No. It's not that.
Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
How is bank?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
I understand. I'm so sorry
You can stay tonight.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Good night.
Put the fucking kettle down.
John.
Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
He wants a lot of money.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Just leave her alone.
I'm so sorry.
Leave her alone.
Is that everything?
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand ants?
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
Yes.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Yes.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Yes.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Yes.
Today is bath day.
Sorry?
I don't understand.
Happy bath day.
Syevodnya
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
Frenzy.
Yes I know.
They go. John. They go.
What's wrong?
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
You don't understand anything.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I don't want to know.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
So what are you going to do?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Well as it turns out I did.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
No I don't.
In the world.
I know you just want to punish me --
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Where's the restroom?
What?
What? No you're not..
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Have you got your passport?
What?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Yes.
Give me some money.
I don't have any money.
What?
I said I don't have any.
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
It's none of your business.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
So uh...
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Oh Jesus.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
But, you know, so what?
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
Why not?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
No.
Okay we won't talk about it.
We'll pretend it never happened.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
I don't hate you.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And? What are you saying?
And who says what is wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Whereas Wet 'n' Wild is an emotional journey. Tied and Tethered. It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Why?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
So now you hate all women?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You...
I got what I paid for.
You didn't mind too much.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
Get out
You are throwing me out.
Get out.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
I don't have nothing.
Well what have you got?
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No.
Have you had any before?
No.
Are you scared?
What happened between you and the blonde?
What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
She's dead.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
What?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
She's alive?
Laugh it up.
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I'm trying to quit.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Nobody's that unhappy.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Except for Small Eyes.
I don't know.
What was her name?
What's your name?
You know you can come under the blanket.
It's alright.
No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Thank you.
Whatever.
Because it was a lie.
Goodbye.
Something else.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
I'm sorry.
Please.
It's not mine.
It's not mine either.
It's what you came back for.
Why?
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Tell me about it.
Maybe you will find out.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
Right.
My name's Sophia.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Is the flight full?
Thanks.
Cash.
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Only we call them agents.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Because they're still here.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Were you followed?
Agents.
Who?
Describe him.
No.
That's not Carson Dyle.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
CafÃš.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
That's the spirit.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Okay -- up there.
Open it.
Keep going.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
That's the idea.
Then who does?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Not my room!
I'll take that.
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
You loved him?
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He was a wealthy man?
Where did he keep his money?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
It is all right.
Is it all right?
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
And this?
And this? And this?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list
How's that?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Peter Joshua.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Please, not on my account.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Oh. I guess.
Is your husband with you?
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Where did everything go?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Doing what?
Instant divorce you mean?
Come on. You can't stay here.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
What's going on?
I'm still having trouble with English.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
You mean you and me?
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
Who said?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
I wasn't --
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
What your husband was mixed up in.
Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
On the street where you live.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
What?
Good night.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
What?
Go on.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
So they think he left it with you.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Who is it?
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
What'd he say?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Good night.
Va jouer, mon ange.
Ãƒa alors! From Charles?
But what?
But why do you want a divorce?
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
He knows everything.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Do you know him?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
He's allergic to him.
Who is it from?
What is it about?
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Oh la vache!
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
What's the matter, chÃšrie?
We will separate -- you look over there.
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah? What's that?
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
Who invited you?
We want that money -- now!
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
Okay, okay.
At least somebody likes this shit.
Oh...
...shit.
Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Damn.
It's a damn postal truck!
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
...that is going to explode...
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Come on, Night Shift.
A little early for a delivery.
Oh...
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Where's Sam?
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Where do you want this stuff?
Freezer in the back.
Great.
Art.
That's my business.
No argument there.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Since when does...
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...moron.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.
Uh, huh?
Except for the fact that I need cash.
He could've called first.
...and fair...
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Huh?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
Oh.
Why don't I--?
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
...and a shitload of ice.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...-tana.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...ya?
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
For cryin' out loud.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
...truck.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible.
All right.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You want cash?
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
No.
All right, then how about this?
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
...doing?!
You are not takin' my truck!
Go on.
Would you hurry up, please?
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Shut...
...up.
Are you kiddin'?
Come on!
Damn.
What the hell's goin' on?
It happens to this piece of shit...
...all the time.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
Excuse me...
...-ed.
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Do you wanna give me a minute?
You'd better coast through...
...town.
We're clear.
Oh, man.
No cell.
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
...-er.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
No, no, no.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
...-er.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Am I missing somethin' here?
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  We're goin' to McGruder.
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
That's...
...fine.
Hey.
Fine.
God-...
Okay, okay!
Ah, one of them's in the back.
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
Okay.
Shut up.
Take your gun!
Doesn't...
...work!  It's not even load-...
...-ed.
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!
Oh, shit.
Oh...
All right.
Elvis is on ice again.
Nice job back there.
Don't gimme that nice job shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
Kiss my ass!
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
No...
...I'm not the psycho.
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...you.
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...I believe in live and...
Yeah...
...let live.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
I did not steal the truck.
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
...truck!
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...waiting!
Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.
Oh!
Holy shit...
...man!
Oh, shit.
Back up!  Back...
Come on, old...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
All right, you got it.
Fuck!
Oh, shit.
Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...Shift.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy!
...we can make it.
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
...do we?
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!
Oh, shit.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on!
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Oh...
...easy, easy, easy.
Left, left, left!
Get over!  Get over!
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Night Shift, but you might...
...wanna give it a try!
Come on, old...
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on...
...you crazy bastard.
All right, you got it, you got it!
Whoo!
Whoo!
I made it!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
You okay?
What the fuck was that?!
Shit.  You gotta pass him.
Gee, you think so?
Okay.  That didn't work.
Gee, you think so?
Shut up!
Oh...
...ho!
...shit!
Hang on!
Hey!
Go on.
Go, go.
No.  Shit.
Come on.
Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay.
All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
Okay.  Okay.
Yeah...
...yeah.
Aw, shit
All right, let's go.
Okay.  All right.  Okay.
Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.
Listen!  Listen...
...to him!  You don't know who...
...you're dealin' with!
I'm a dangerous man!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...man!
Taking it down the hill.
You're--?  What?!
Then stay...
...here!
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
I don't want you to come anyway.
Come on!
Oh, shit.
Keep still.
Okay.  Okay.
Oh, shit!
Oh, no!
All right.  Hey.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
What?
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
Okay.
Worth a try.
...did you?
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...-tion?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...stole the truck.
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...piece of shit was worth.
It won't even start half the time.
You know what I'm sayin'?
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
So you took his...
...truck.
You know.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
We were nationally  ranked.
How wonderful for you.
Robert Del Rio?
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
...hospital.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
We got two paddles.
Listen, Arlo...
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...shit.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...shit.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
...split.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
...miles.
Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
That is loud!  I'm
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
Hey.   Mason.
Yeah.
I think you oughta cut a...
...deal with this asshole.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
...or my conscience.
...man.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Bring him down!
You all right?
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
Ow!
Are you all right?
No.
Hey!
They're takin' off.
Huh?
They're movin'.
Hey, just shut up.
We're gonna die!
Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.
Put your hand in my pants.
What?
Arlo!  Arlo.
Reach into my pocket.
Come on!
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
Okay.
All right.  Okay.
Okay.
Arlo!
I'm sorry.  I'm a little
Okay.
Come on, come on!
Okay, here we go.
Come here.
Go, go, go!
That's why I didn't give it...
What?
You got Elvis?!
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Go!
Stop.
Hang...
...-ful?!
Okay.  Okay.
Oh, fuck!
Forty-five seven!
We!
I've got the real thing!
...they come!
And Brynner's right on...
Okay...
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
Tunnel.
Whoo!
Whoo!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
What the hell?
What the--?
You've gotta be...
Stupid.
Shoot me.
What's it say?
Forty-nine point four.
It says forty- nine.
Mason.
What?
It's melting, man.
All right
Oh.
Come on.  Come on.
What?
It's working.
...-ta get outta here!
Vitelli! Vitelli!
Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Hold this.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
Hang on, hang on.
Let's go!
Go.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
They'll meet you at the top.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
What'd you come back for?!
Why'd you stay behind?!
Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!
Well.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Stop limpin' around like that.
Always the negative...
You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You, Arlo.
Hello.
You.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Us.  Owes us.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
Patriotism is its own reward.
I think so too.
Yeah.
What about all that no need to get in the man's...
...face crap you've been telling me?
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...us.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
No.
That's bullshit.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Oh!
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Yeah.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Yeah.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
Yeah.
you see, that was a-that was my mission.
big balls.
That's right.
Hey.
Hey, be cool.
Be cool.  Be--
That was quick.
We're worried...
...about him.
I'll keep an eye out.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
It's for you.
What'd he say?
Listen, shithead!
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Oh, my God.
I urge you to be persuasive.
This country trained me to kill...
Well, well, well.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Three seconds.  One...
And it won't be pleasant.
But...
...such is the price...of patriotism.
Vaughn.
Hey!
Well, that just about figures for today.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
...help you?
Yeah, that's my truck.
Mason, you have to take this...
...to Fort McGruder in his truck.
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
...take my sorry old truck.
We do need your truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
I had no idea how powerful it was.
Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...here.   Mason...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
Hey, actually...
You got a prob-...
...-lem too?
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Listen, deputy.
He's the dude...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
We've got it...
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
Us.  Owe us.
Exactly.
Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
Doc-...
...-tor Long.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
...-lar.
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
...-bility.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
Now listen to me.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
You have my word on that.
All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
Let's proceed.
I am become Death, the...
...destroyer of worlds."
You'll kill us all!
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
It's too...
Andrew...
...I wish they would've let me say something...
...about--
Is this stool taken?
No, go--
You look fit...healthy...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...that.
...and the government.
Grateful?
Mm-hm.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...you were right, of course.  But after...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Went away?
Almost quaint.
All right.  After they put you away...
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
And let me guess.  You failed.
So far, ye-yes.
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
Do you know what'll...
...happen if I drop this?
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Pleasant surprise.
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street.  Fan out and work your way back to the motel.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
...comes up that road.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Of which we have more than enough.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
Hit him.
Hit him again.
Vaughn.
Check it out.
Check the immediate area.
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Prep the launcher now.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Dennis!
Get your links set up!
I wanna patch in from...
...here!
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Stay put.  Keep the camera trained on...
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
Right.  Tim Mason.
You know the suspect?
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
...general store.
Richard Long.
Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous...
...-fall.
But...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...screwup?
...scientists.
...gear?
They'll get a break tomorrow.
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
Mornin'.
Is this your establishment?
....-lene.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
...dangerous.
...deer.
I beg your pardon?
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
Assumptions are always dangerous.
Doc...
Not tonight...
...though.
Odd, then, that his car...
Yeah?
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
I don't know what the hell...
I want you to look at one another...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
Hello.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
I don't see my container.
You try anything, it goes in...
...the river.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
...-tainer!
Where's Arlo?
Bring him up.
...-spite the mouth.
Him first.
It won't be long, gentlemen.
...checked.
You'd never understand!
I would've in another life.
They took that life away and left me with nothing.
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...-time,  remember?
I can handle it.
Yeah?
Two pots of coffee...
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Oh, no?
Ah.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
That little geek is my...
...son.
Thanks.
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
After that re-...
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
Excellent.
Been trying to figure out your secret.
My secret?
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout...
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...the master of his realm.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Tie a fly...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...back...
...and that power...
...without caution...
...is death.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...-to a simple thing like...
...fishin'.
Some people might.
Doc!
Mason.
Shit!  Oh, shit.
Call an ambulance.
No...
...or it'll ignite.
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
And what if it does?
Everything will die, Mason.
You're the only one I can trust.
The only one who understands what this me-...
...-m-means, Mason.
Doctor.
Yeah, I just....
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.
Let me have those.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
What?
Yeah, yeah...
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
We've got the real thing!
I'm at mile marker...
Yeah.
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...-lem?
You find yourself wearing a...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
...you answer mine.
Got that?
So you don't remember...
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...seriously.
That's not the way I...
Lying?
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...public drunkenness....
...beer.
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me son.
Then how about if I call you ass-...
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Let me see your...
...hands!
I said let me see your hands now!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...stole a truck under arrest.
Listen, Pappas...
...there's a colonel...
...on the other end of this phone.
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
...side!
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
...we're all gonna die in this...
...tunnel now!
Just go check the temperature.
What the hell was that?
Jesus.
All right.
I'll lead 'em out.
You sure?
Fol-...
Okay, doc.
The usual.  Doc.
Get in
Gimme this god-...
Talk to me.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
So I can have these?
What are you doing here?
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
Fifty lire...
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
But you don't have any kids!!!
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going.
Toto, come here.
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Then why don't you change jobs?
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
No...
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing.
But don't you like anything about what you do?
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt!
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!!
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
It tastes wonderful!
Will they really find work in Germany?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal...
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Too bad!
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?
Come in, Alfredo.
How's school?
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Why? What do you mean?
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
Yes. I want proof.
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going?
Yes.
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
What's she like? What's she like?...
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants...
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world!
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Could be...But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.
You weren't expecting me?
You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
No, nobody came.
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
Did you ever see her again?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him...
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am.
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
Thanks for all you've done for me.
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little...
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Elena. My name's Elena.
Hi, Elena!
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh?
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
Father, I have sinned...
We'll talk about that later.
But...who...
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
I don't care. I'll wait.
For what?
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
Elena!...But when...
So what'd they say?
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Who?
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
You're still beautiful...
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs...
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation...
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending.
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
I don't remember him any moreÃ¹Ma, where's Russia?
No...
Somebody stole it.
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
You never used to do that!
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
OK...
How long's it been shut?
Are you serious?
What is this, a poll?
What the hell is that?
You're shittin' me.
What's this?
Well, if it's already too late...
It's not the same.
Jesus!
I'll just take the gum.
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Thanks. Have a good one.
Sure. Go ahead.
Beats me.
Fifty-five.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
Hey, now wait a sec...
I think you'd better leave now.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
Yeah, but not in here.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
I take it she likes the guy.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
She said not to come home until graduation.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Can I watch?
You can hold me down.
Can I join in?
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Dick.
Exactly.
So where is he?
He went home to change for the big date.
God, isn't he great?
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Why aren't there any lights?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
You're kidding.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
Such a sordid state of affair.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
I'll try to manage.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Awww. That was so cute.
Am I missing something here?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
I was here the whole time.
You two better quit it.
Nobody! I swear!
I feel nauseous.
No, don't!
When did you get back?
Just now.
Dante. You've got a customer.
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.
I can't believe you're here.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
You saw it?
Very dramatic, I thought.
It's not what you think.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
I'm not pregnant.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
And you said yes?
Well... kind of, sort of?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
How do you know that?
So you're really getting married?
No.
No, you're not really getting married?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
How like her.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
I love a macho faÃ¾ade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
But you were.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
I'm giving him his ring back.
What?
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
Sang? His name is a past tense?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
There's more, isn't there?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You don't have anything to do with it.
You lie.
Look how full of yourself you are.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
But can we date?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
You work in a market, all right.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Let me take you out tonight.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You have a better suggestion?
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
What about Sing?
Sang.
Sang.
He's not invited.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
So what are you saying?
You're such an asshole.
I'm just kidding.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Who doesn't?
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
How'd you get here so fast?
I left like an hour ago.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Like what?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
It wasn't me.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Was it you?
I'm serious.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
No.
Stop this. This isn't funny.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Are you sure somebody was back there?
Call the police.
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
Just me.
We did.
Nobody. It was closed.
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Well he asked me for it!
What about Caitlin?
Are you open?
Yeah.
Pack of cigarettes.
This is the last time I come to this place.
Excuse me?
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
Who are you to make assessments?
I'll assess all I want!
Like you're better!
I can whip your ass.
That's easy to say from over here.
Are you open?
Yes.
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
Well, he missed!
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
So I'm told.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
Lenin's Tomb.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Are you open?
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
What's your point?
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
You open?
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You only brought one ball?!
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
Go open the sore.
Shocking abuse of authority.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
No, thanks.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Why?
You don't want to know.
You called Caitlin again?
She called me.
Did you tell Veronica?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
What do you two fight about?
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
You win.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Eight and a half.
Eight and a half?
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
That's cheating?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
She called you Brad?
She called me Brad.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl Mom.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
What do you mean?
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
That girl was vile to you.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Your mother.
Allan Harris.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
That's frightening.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Oh yeah.
You think things would be any different now?
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
What about Veronica?
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
I think it's safe to say yes.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancÃš.
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Blasphemy.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
What's that?
All right, Vader's boss...
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
How do you mean?
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
I guess.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Yeah.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
It would stand to reason, yes.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
More or less.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
I think they were Catholics.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
There's more?
So they build another Death Star, right?
Yeah.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
And you figured it out?
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Basically.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
And the second time around...?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
So?
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
She's in here?
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
What's he looking for?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Perfect dozen.
The quest isn't going well?
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
What's a jizz-mopper?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Nudie booth?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
I guess not.
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
What kind of show?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids.
The milkmaids?
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Which ones?
No.
Why not?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Veronica!
Thirty-seven!
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
Vermont?
Can you believe this?!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
FUCK!
Why'd you apologize?
What?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
I know.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
I don't back down.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
You know what pisses me off the most?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
Because you buckled.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Don't yell at me, pal.
See? There you go again.
At least we're stuck here together.
You've got a customer.
Pull my laces tighter.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Design major.
Can we not talk about this?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Then where're we gonna play?
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
Gatorade.
Exactly. They drank it all.
It's not like we're gonna sell out.
You know what Sanford told me?
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Julie Dwyer died.
Yeah, right.
No, I'm serious.
Oh, my god.
How? When?
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Jesus.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Number six.
You've had sex with a dead person.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
Why not?
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
You hardly knew her!
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
You hate people.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
If you go, I go.
She meant nothing to you!
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
You were saying?
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Broke his neck.
That's embarrassing?
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
Shut the hell up.
Stop it.
I swear.
No!
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Who found him?
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
His dick was in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
Yeah, but at what a price.
Reach what?
You know.
What, your dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I never tried it.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
Listen to you.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
I can't fucking believe you!!
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Her fucking body fell out!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Just... go! Go open the video store.
Let me borrow your car.
I don't want to talk to you.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
You want to rent a movie.
What's that for?
You work in a video store!
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
Let me borrow your car.
May I be blunt with you?
If you must.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
What?
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
Exactly.
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
Not yet.
What the fuck did you do that for?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Please, get the hell out of here.
I know I'm your hero.
Get to work.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
And this is what you rented?
I like to expand my horizons.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
You're bullshitting.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Living proof.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
I don't; you did.
Holy shit. That girl?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Because I'm here.
You're lying.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Because I'm happy.
I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
You're kidding.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You're a snake.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
I'll read the book.
Who eats cock?
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
There's no lights back there.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Fuck you.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
Could be.
You just fucked a total stranger?
Shut the fuck up!
She said she did all the work.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Around three or something.
I think four.
This life.
This life?
Why do I have this life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Thirty-seven.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
I was born.
You should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
Fuck you.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
What responsibility?
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
As if it's that easy.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Leave me alone.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Oh, like your life's any better?
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Leave her out of this.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
Leave me alone.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Am I right or what?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Make them change.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Lovely story.
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
How's your eye?
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
It's hard to swallow.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Thanks.
Jesus.
You still didn't have to choke me.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
How do you figure?
What time did you get to work today?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
To talk to you.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  I'm not even supposed to be here today.  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
You need a ride?
Got one. Just pulled up.
Do you work tomorrow?
Same time. What about you?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
I'll call you. Let you know.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Helluva day.
To say the least.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Get the fuck outta here already.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Yes.
Thirty-fire.
I don't have love handles.
Do I know you?
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
THE GLADES MOTEL?
Jesus Christ, what next?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Excuse me?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
I don't think so.
They are not.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
I am not.
How much can you bench?
I don't know.
Oh for God's sake!
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Yeah.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Yeah?
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
To you?
What?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
I... I don't believe this...
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Are there any balls down there?!
Go open the video store.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
I'm not dealing.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
I should start.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
With you? I don't think so.
Listen to you. Oh shit. Oh
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
It's not my store.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
What's that mean?
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
So.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there. That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
We were going to start again, I think.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Veronica.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Lasagne.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it... No, wait. I fucked up. She said What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?
Meaning?
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Be careful.
I'm trying.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
The white kind.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Yeah, but...
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
Jesus... go ahead.
Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
The porno mags?
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Here. Now leave me alone.
Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
At least they weren't lit.
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Why did you agree to come in then?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
You're kidding.
Bunch of savages in this town.
What were you doing up so late?
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
What? What is that?
She called you, didn't she?
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
You're trusting.
Why do you say that?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
How do you figure?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
Be there?
How flattering.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
Something wrong?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just being there-as you put it-is not enough.
I touched a nerve.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many what?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
Twelve.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Including you; yes.
What the hell was that for?
You're a pig.
Why'd you hit me?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three.
Three?
Three including you.
You've only had sex with three different people?
I'm not the pig you are.
Who?
You!
No; who were the three, besides me?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Where?
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
Why do you call him that?
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
He gets off on it.
Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
I'm serious...
You sucked that guy's dick?
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
That's because I never had sex with him!
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Please calm down.
Dante...
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Let it go...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Well...?
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Lower your voice!
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.
Hey! Where are you going?!
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I feel sick.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Goodbye, Dante.
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
What is it?
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
Really?  You're the best.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
You had to tell him.
What did he say?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
And that made you feel better?
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Sure.
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
What're you talking about?
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
It was only a few times...
A couple...?
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Would you let me explain...
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
I don't want to go back with her...
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
Randal...?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Veronica, I love you...
Fuck you.
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
I think it's coming now...
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
What?
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
What's this?
WHAT?
What are you talking about?
I didn't do that!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, Berserker!
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing...
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans or something like that.
Come on, man, Berserker!
English.  Come on, Berserker! Girls think sexy.
I think the lady called it.
I do about three-fifty, four.
Feel that.
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
Because he's out of shape.
Yeah!
Really?
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
I like the way you think.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
No, I wasn't.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
I hope it feels good.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
You'll be missed.
That's the price, my brother.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I'll see you there.
And... he told you all of this?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
I... I don't know what to say.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Which one?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Says who?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks.
Willam!
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
I will. Take it easy.
Bye  That was Snowball.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
What are you doing?
Wired?    I ain't wired.
You killed her!
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
They don't have a murder weapon?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero.   That's all I know.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
It's Elvis...
It's me...
Oui.
No.
Oui.
Oui.
Where's your brother?
What?
You don't trust me?
It's Daniel.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
I guess we're going to find out.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
Half the tapes.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
How about if I call you?
Thank you.
Tonight?
I know they won't be home tonight.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
What kind of business?
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
We can't.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Why is everything an argument with you?
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
Jesus!
Hopefully no one.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
We'll see.
Cops?
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Bring me the scissors.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
I can't believe you didn't check.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
We'll think of something.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
I think he's already figured that out.
That moron.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
No.
You're sure?
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's Sunflowers in a vase I would remember it.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
We still have to get out of here.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
This is Zero.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
I'll be Elvis and you--
It's not?
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
No.   Chicks dig me.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
We have to find Sophie.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
All right, knock it off.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Hadley --
No?
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Hello?
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
What'd you get?
Some bread and...
Can I trust you, Sami?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
You haven't answered my question.
Does it really matter what I say?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I will.
You better.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
Guns.   Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
Don't bullshit me.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
I'm from Belgium.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Why haven't you turned us in?
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
How much?
A thousand dollars?
Fine.
Yeah?
It's me.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
did you set it up?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
We had a deal.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
What?
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
The map said to go left.
Oh yeah.
There has to be.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
I was told to take what we have and go.
They don't have a wine list.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
You can use my car.
No, I didn't.
Yes.
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
This kind.
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
What the hell is he talking about?
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
No.   How much?
How about Canada?
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Yeah, I can see that.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
Me?
You lived there. You know the city.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
I want to be Elvis.
It's my idea.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
Mr. Taylor?
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
Vase with twelve Sunflowers.
Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
You guys used to work together?
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
The baseball is mine.
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
No.
Give it to me, Sami.
No!
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
Oh, you think?
Holy shit.
Wait here.
Where is it, Sophie?
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
You're not helping.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Algeria.
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
I can't even hear myself think.
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
I don't know.
He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
Thanks.
When do we go?
Tonight.
You ever hear of jet lag?
Take a nap.
You like shoes?
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
They're not nice people.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Something like that.
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
You ask a lot of questions.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
You got it in a bar?
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
Who's gonna see it there?
The lucky ones.
Can't sleep?
No.
What are you doing?
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Sounds boring.
After last night I could say the same for you.
Stick around and find out.
Why?
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Can we go now?
You understand what you'll be doing?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Right.
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
What?
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
The usual...
First Lady...
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
They barely talk anymore.
You're kidding?
It happens.  This is where you'll be sleeping.
Holy cow.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Oh... Okay.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
What's with her?
Don't worry about it.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
For a month.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I promise.  I won't.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Great.
I'm not certain about...
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
... Alright.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Mr. President...
I mean,  if it's a problem...
What the hell is this?
That shelter was in this bill.
Alan
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
) Listen, you little...
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
Well it's a last minute change.
.. Nothing.
Choices???
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
Share...
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Oh... I'm fired?
Yeah.
Fine?
Fine.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Where's the girl?
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Nightmare...
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I don't give a shit.
Bob...
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Till what?
TilT we figure something out.
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Up and around?  Soon?
Soon.
A condition...
We think so.
Yes.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
I was a senator, you know.
What about containment, Alan?
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
Is that everybody?
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
What about her.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
And...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Fine.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
What about the wife?
Clean.
Check his kids.
Clean.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
Are you out of your mind?
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Oh.  Excuse me.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
When does it break?
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
You're kidding.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Three years.
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Oh.  Fine.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
I don't think so.
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to kill him.
You can't kill a President.
He's only doing what you told him to.
What I told him to?
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
He was only doing his job.
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Bob...
Don't do this.
I'll lock him away for good.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Are you threatening me?
Uh-oh...
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Jesus...
So you want to go swimming?
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
It's fine.
They could put you in jail.
I don't think so
The government
I am the government.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I'm not sure.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I'm not sure.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Choices?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
You could buy it on payments.
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
So what do we do?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
That'd be great.
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
Extend things?
Extend them.  C'mere for a second.
Oh my God...
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
What happened?
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Will he be alright?
Oh, yeah... probably...
No.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
I'm not sure... I might have.
In the car.
I see what you mean.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
A teleprompter.
What?
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
I don't think so.
Oh.
Presence.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
What?
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
Thanks, I wrote it.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Dave...
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
Dave!
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Fine.
Fine.
Gimme a quarter.
What?
Quick.  Gimme a quarter.
President vetoes works bill?
We vetoed that?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
What do you mean you made it all up?
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
This is wrong, Alan!
Wrong...
Alan...
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
We've got to fix this.
`Dave'?
Now he's making stuff up about me.
He's not.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Does it make the cars any better?
Perceptual?
Why?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Ah.
Certainly.
Something like what...
The Fidelity nonsense...
They re not my attack dogs.
Oh... Hi.
... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.
You know.  Your first campaign.
Really?
Oh... Kinda the same way.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
You're not?
No.
Your government needs your help.
What?
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
We'd like to hire you.
Really?
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
I can't say.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
I can't say.
Oh.
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
Yeah.
You got a gun?
You ever use it?
No.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
What about it?
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Certainly.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
`Bleed for your king.'
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
Didn't mean to bum you out.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
Who?
The Vice-President...
Well...
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
No thanks.  It's not that far.
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
Thanks, Duane.
What are you staring at?
Uh...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
You bet.
I'm outta here.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
You don't change, do you, Bill?
Since when do you care about the homeless?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
... How could I what?
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
I don't understand.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
What's wrong with a magic trick?
You made their funding disappear!
Look.  If there was some mistake...
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
... . Ellen.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Oh... Yeah.
Mind if I sit down?
No.
Anybody would have done it.
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
I don't know.
They asked me to help.
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
You're leaving?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
Where are you going?
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
You1re leaving, too?
How were you gonna get home?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
You sure this goes somewhere?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
I don't mind.
Thanks.
Oh... Okay.
What?
It's just so strange...
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
Are you hungry?
I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.
Just wait.
You have a lot of secrets.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
You find people jobs?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
I know.
But you could go to jail for it.
It was okay?
It was inspirational.
Well I guess...
What?
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
What's wrong?
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
They're crucifying you out there.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
You really believe that?
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
I sure fall for some weird guys.
What?
Hi.
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I never thought I'd...
I know.
I missed...
... Me, too.
So this is it?
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
It could be fun.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
We're working on it.
We're doing our best, sir.
We're all set,  sir.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
All set.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I'll take it.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Who are these people?
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
Gee -- that Fair --
It hasn't opened yet?
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
Guess there will, if it says so.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Young man -- you got me there.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
And what about Daniel Webster?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
And serve him right!
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
Why? It don't hurt.
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
No! No! I won't.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Mama!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
Grandma, look at me!
Not me!
Howdy, Hank.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Sure am.
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
Black Dan'l?
What do you want?
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
You're not -- Dorothy.
She couldn't be gone!
Belle --
Stevens!
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
in gold.
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Some other time, Stevens.
No, you're not.
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
Now run along, Daniel.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
What's the matter with you?
Afraid ... of what?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
Opportunities?
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Where did it come from?
Yes, why shouldn't it?
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
No, no! Give it to me!
Well, I'll be --
The seventh day of April --
Look here now--
Leave your tongue off of that!
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
My time isn't up yet.
I'm through with you.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
About what?
Never!
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
You know darn well it is.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Ten throws it is.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
What -- what's on your mind?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Yes -- at midnight.
Not long -- now.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
There's no joy in it for me.
Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Well, I --
I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Headache -- Squire?
Camomile tea!
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
But -- I was just lucky.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
You really think so?
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: Look
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Coming.
Down, Shep! Down!
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
You're right, Mary.
I think his leg is broken.
Yep.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
That's what we said.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.
Well -- what are we going to do?
Your butter money?
Mary -- it's gone.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Mary--
Mary -- how do you feel?
I'll get the doctor.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Mary -- what would you do?
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Remember, Mary, how he said it: Couldn't have done better myself
Tired?
There is nothing to worry about now.
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Mary --
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
Thanks, Mary.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
I'm serious.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Well -- I -- I-
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
Isn't that your own fault?
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
It shows on your face.
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
Why don't they come --
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Mary! Come back ...
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Mary!
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Hard luck -- like me.
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
I dunno.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Me -- a son.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Do you really think that?
It don't matter!
I say -- it don't matter.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Ma -- is she? --
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Sure, Ma.
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
It's all right, Sheriff.
Let him try it.
Hello, Sheriff.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Come in, Sheriff.
Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie --
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
I'll do my best, Mary.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Hullooo!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself.
Me?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
I object.
Hi!
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
You like it?
I'm Adam Webber.
Really?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
How do you do?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Come where?
Yes, ma'am.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
How do you do?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Please excuse this interruption.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Are you French?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
No, you get out of here.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Where are we going?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
No, I'm lost.
You're lost?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Dickhead?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
What's wrong with you?
I just had a mental picture of...
Here, pick these up!
I came on a bus.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Oh, that's nice.
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
So far?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Again.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
It was amazing.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Do you own a car?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
You don't?
Nope.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Yes.
And that's it?
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
You're it.
Actually we have something for you.
Oh my god, are you alright?
Wait!  Wait!
It's Perry!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Hi.
Depends how you define 'new'...
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah. How'd you know?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Four colors? Neato!
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
HARRY Dunne.
Heddo Jeth-ica.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
HARRY!
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
You and Lloyd chose the class!?
Excuse me?
Come over around seven.
O'clock?
Yeah...
Gotcha.
Ooh gross.
Would you like something to drink?
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Just down the hall.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
How's that?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
HARRY? Are you okay?
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a I-crapped-my-pants.
Coming.
What are you wearing?
Okay.
Okay, what?
Hey look, it's our teacher.
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
Well la de da.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
I'm just not ready.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
Wow just like Marco Polo.
You know Mom, like in the pool.
I know a short-cut.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Mom, you know that never works.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Probably because we've never met.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
I haven't seen you around here before.
Home school. Til today.
Home school? What's that?
I go to school where I live.
Me too!
I think it's just over there.
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
Cool.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that X. But... I do know something.
What?
You're it.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
No no no no no.
Why not?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
No.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Me too!
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!
Shift to your left.
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
The principal.
Wow.
Oh, is this your special place?
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
H A R R Y...
The second R is silent.
One day they'll find a cure.
You brave soldier.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
Got any crazy eights?
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Who's Captain Rob?
Just a guy I hang out with.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Sounds like a pirate.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Yeah, he's a pirate.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says yo ho ho has a peg leg...
Peg leg?
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Exactly! A pirate!
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Right.
Whoa. What was that?
What?
Your mom made a move on me.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Will not.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Shut up!
I will stop this car right now.
You're not my real dad.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
Now you see why he was elected principal?
HARRY.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
No.
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
Don't look directly at him.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
And he invented fire.
Nice jugs.
They can't be real.
You're it.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
You're it.
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I can't, it's yours.
Take it. damn it!
Okay.
These are really cold, huh?
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
I don't know. Owwww.
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Put some ice on it.
Owww.
And my mouph is frozen.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
...cause you said...
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
HARRY! Here he comes.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Our own special bus.
How do you know it's for us?
Nope. I was right.
Wanna bet?
Why are you doing that?
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Sucks for you.
Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
That's a cow, Harry.
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Some what?
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
Sure I do. On one condition.
You can't marry my mom.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Shut up!
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
HARRY, can you hear me?
Yes.
You have beautiful eyes.
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
Hey, where did you come from?
Do you want me to pet your head?
I bet you want your head scratched.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
So, have you given him some yet?
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
But-
HARRY!
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your girlfriend?
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Captain Rob came back?
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
No one knows?
Me, me, me!
No. What happened?
A raft.
A blimp.
A turd.
George Washington!
Who?
Hello, he only invented money!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be it.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You certainly did.
I know I did.
Sorry, no further questions.
You're it.
Am not.
Are, too.
D2.
No. Look.
Hey, it's Jessica.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
Cute puppy.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
But my mom gave me the map.
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
No.
Thank-Q!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
I think it's the eyes.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
I don't know who we are anymore.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
Do you know what this means?
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
And like she said, do it before the parade.
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
Wait, wait!
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Roger that, Wilco.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
Right.
Okay. Which one do you want?
The one on the left.
That's the one I wanted.
She's one of a kind.
Try one in a million!
Well, what should we do?
Why not go to work for me?
Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
You take her.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
Sorry, Charlie.
Hey, where'd you go?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
That's gross.
I know.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
So can I come along?
No.
Oh, you're good.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
You mean the lunch room?
I thought I told you to get lost.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
You had some questions.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
Oh I think you do.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
Not to expect you tonight.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
TURK, leave him alone.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Why ith dat newth?
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Yes, what?
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Do you want me to pet your head?
What are you doing here?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
What?
You know, some. The fag stuff.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
I know, you want go for a ride.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
So, when can we do it?
Tomorrow night?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Well, something stinks.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
What are you doing?
Let's just do it and get out of here.
I'm so close I can feel it.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That's it. I'm done.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
That's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
Looks like the best man won.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
My dream date with Principal Collins.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
You were born free and free you should remain.
Do I know you?
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
You really are a pirate.
So I'm an arrrrrs-hole, eh Captain Rob?
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
That's the downside. There is none.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Do we have a deal?
Ha! I said doll-hairs. Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
Uh-oh. Harry?
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
I liked it a lot.
Hey can be on top?
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Have you got what I want?
Oh yeah, give it to me.
Wait! Wait!
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Thanks, Pop.
We're not crazy. We're special. PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
No.
People! Come on. Parade float.
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
Obviously.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
What?
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Sorry.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I think you did it.
What the hell are you talking about?
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are South of the Border days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
God, I've missed you.
And I you.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Night!
It's the big potato.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
We start our own class?
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
You said aloha twice.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Oh wow. Look at you.
Times two.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
Yes!
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
And...?
And you are great in bed.
Knock knock.
Who's there?
Guess whats under these coconuts.
It's a surprise.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
You got the Extender?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
So what do you keep in there?
Everything?
Everything. Just for the record.
Oh, just like the President.
Just like the President.
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
What papers?
The evidence of what?
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
Where is it?
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
This band sounds terrible.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
Love it!
Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
Thank you.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
A wife?
Yes.
Because I want to get married.
Why?!
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
I didn't know that.
Everybody's divorced.
It didn't used to be that way.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
When do you need her by?
Two weeks.
Of course.
Thank you.
Get out!
The engine is still running.
Now, get out!!
Yes, ma'am!
Sorry!
Greetings.  I am the Count.
It is my home.
Uh, beg to differ.
Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count...
It's a pleasure...
You almost got us killed!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
Yes!
I like it.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
No.  I don't work here.
Huh?
Who are you?  What do you want?
Ha!
Why were you buying a coffin?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Really?
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Thank you.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Don't you bave a car?
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
I have no next picture.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
But you're a big star!
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
They were mythic.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
The women?
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
I never thought of that.
Take my word for it.  You want to score with a young lady, you take her to see Dracula.
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
What?!
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Are you sure this is okay?
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
I don't understand.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Yeah.  You pull the strings --  Pull the strings... hey, that's pretty good!
I am always on time.
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, that's a part that takes acting.
Of course!  Dracula requires presence.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
Thank-Q!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Who do I play?
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's angry!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his daughter behave this way!
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once Glen Or Glenda takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
That's good.  I could use the money.
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we know the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be Dracula.
Of course!
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
So let's make another Dracula. Let's make The Return of Dracula!
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
Dracula?
No!  Doctor Acula!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Should I call a doctor?
Nah.  This happens all the time...
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
Goulash.
I don't know how to make goulash.
What's in the needle?
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Don't worry.  I'll do something.
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure. Audience laughs.  Applause.  Say
It is my home.
Oh, tract housing, huh?  Laugh. You need a new real estate agent.
Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
Um-hum.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yes!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Wow.
No Bela, that's incorporates.  Look, just say This casket has...
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
I never said I could ad-lib...
Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
We didn't make a dime.
Bela, are you ready?
Mmph?  Where am I?
You'll be sitting on the right.
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on The Return Of Chandu.
Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the left.
Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say Dear
Dear, you're lovely.  Strap her to the table.
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
Eddie, you screwed up.
Yeah, I did.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Really?
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
So why didn't you do it?
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
But maybe not.
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
Good for you.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Out there?!  What happened to the stream?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Do you know I turned down Frankenstein?
Huh?
After I did Dracula
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Don't let me slow you down.
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Why are you here??
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
What are you doing?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Don't you have any savings?
Where's he gone?
He has a computer?
Sure.
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
Uh...yeah.
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Don't worry.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
What happened?!
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Soon, Bela... Soon.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Okay.  But what if I'm not in too big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
That's great.  Let's do a take.
And, cut...
Eddie, how was I?
Perfect.
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
Last night was quite a romp.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I know none of my wives would've.
All right.
So, what are you seeing?
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
No problem.  I know it by heart...
I don't know.  Where?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
Jesus!  Are you serious?
Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a monster! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
What do you mean?
The what?
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
This is the big moment...!
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
What do you think you're doin'?!
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a lake!
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
Wow.
Edward Wood, Sir.
H-how'd you know?!
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
I don't understand.
It's that easy?
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
The guy with the underpants!
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes you just know.  She's perfect for me.
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Will he be okay?
Isn't he?
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
The ghost can be barefoot.  Give me your shoes!
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Ed, it was only one review.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made Citizen Kane.  I'm already 30!
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're supposed to be struggling.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are you the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
You got the job?!!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something better happened!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody really big!
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
No!  A horror movie star!
Close!  The other one!
You met Basil Rathbone!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
I thought he was dead.
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
So did you get his autograph?
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
This is my way of telling you --
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
About clothing?
Yeah.
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
It's a damn good role.
That's not the issue!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
It takes me comfortable.
Oh, just like in the script!
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
But you do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Toss us out on our ass.
Exactly.
I'm no good.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But of course I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
That's ridiculous.
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Tell him Bride is in pre- production.
That's the problem!  Nobody cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made Glen Or Glenda.  Directing is my day job.
All I know is, ever since Glen Or Glenda
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
But there's plenty of other parts.
Like what?!
The secretary.  Or the file clerk.
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Goddamn landlord.
I told you this was gonna happen.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
You're a fuckin' mess.
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
I'm going to my mother's.
Does she have room for me?
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
That's right...
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Eddie, what's my motivation?
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Dolores, wait!
But you used to say --
For this one, we need $60,000.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Okay!
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
Yeah.  Exactly!
I kinda need it now.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  Dracula!  The Raven! The Black Cat!
That's not true --
Well, uh, if I could I would...
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Dr. Acula!
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is Bride Of The Atom.
Hey, Eve!
Have you ever heard the saying, He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
No it's not!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Mr. Wood?!
Hruphh...?
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
Yeah...?
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
You could say that --
I'm interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from that, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Graverobbers From Outer Space! It's money in the bank.
Graverobbers from what??
From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  Very big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  And pay my back rent from the profits.
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Lugosi??!  Didn't be pass on?
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as Bela Lugosi's Final Film
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give somebody the dialogue.
And PERFECT.  CUT!
Perfect?  Mr. Wood, do you know anything about the art of film production?!
I like to think so.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Oh, you wanna talk about the big picture?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
Mr. Reynolds!
Yes?
We are gonna finish this film just the way I want it!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Look unimpressed.
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Da pleasure be mine.
Could we moovf to table?
Oh, of course!
Tor!
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
So anyway, I've got this new script, Bride Of The Atom
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
But Greta say --
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Okey-dokey.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
No!  Not crazy!
Do I look crazy?
Yes!
Tor, I should be getting home.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
My eyes are killink me.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
What is happening?
We're escaping!
Excuse me, Sir...?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
I can't believe it.  These sound like my problems!
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even matter if they're right for the part!
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn Variety printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Is there a script?
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Good-bye!
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
Are you a fruit?
No, no, not at all!  I love women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
So you're not a fruit?
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I was wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was terrified of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Tits.
No.  Better than tits -- a star!
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
No!  It would be something better! Something impressive.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Lugosi?
Yeah!  Lugosi!
Isn't he dead?
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
OUR picture?
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
Because he's my friend.
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
There's still a sex-change --
I don't think he's a schmuck.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says I CHANGED MY SEX!
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna grab people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio Beach??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Then how's it gonna get in the picture?!
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it seven reels long. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Um, I guess --
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your Written
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
I thought I was here to meet women.
Not that one!
I like her.
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in Citizen Kane!
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
Where's the ads?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
Why not??
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
Maybe it needs special handling.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: Transvestite He Or She? I Led Two Lives... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Your movie?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!
Hello.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
I got married last night.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Oh.  My condolences.
What are you making?
How long's he been here?
This is my thirteenth pair.
Oh, it's you again.
Oh, hi.
You look beat.
I am.  How's your father?
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Not good...
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
I just picked them up on the way over...
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
Did you find it boring?
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Yeah!  Don't forget Mercury Theatre... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
What have you ordered?
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
What do you mean?
Dracula.
That is incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
A few years ago, I actually saw him do Dracula live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Huh?
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
No! I love sex with girls.
Oh.  Okay.
Okay?
Stop!
STOP!
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
What was that?
Bela died.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- you're not!
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Well you tried --
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Uh, atomic energy?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's more advanced?
Dynamite --
The sun.
Those assholes.
The poor girl's out of a job.
Yeah...  I should give her a call.
No way.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what bitch means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Who's Dr. Tom?
My chiropractor!
I can't get it to go up.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
C'mon!  Let's just go.
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
Let's get married.
Right now.  Let's drive to Vegas!
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be in it!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, Bride Of The Monster.
I know what that's like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the Ghoul's Wife.
Okay. I like that.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last Francis the Mule picture -- it got terrible notices.  But it was a huge hit.
So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Yeah...?
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
You know, to make the legs move --
Really?
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off you can't have me signals!
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
I do.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
No, he would've loved it!  Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula.  CUE VAMPIRA!
Are you IN5ANE?  I'm the director! I make the casting decisions around here!
NOOOOO!!!
I'm directing.
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
That's ridiculous.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
What if I'm vomiting?
I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
No! Do they show you having sex?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
At what point?
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Anything good?
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Yeah. Ma...
Come on...
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Who?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Yeah, so... ?
They celebrated the common person.
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
No.
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
How's your mother?
Al!
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Al!!
Where is she? Is she all right?
You thought it was me?
Yes!
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Went --
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
I'm moving out.
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
What?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Did you?
What did you study?
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Excuse me.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Cool.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
Um, yeah -- thanks.
No, uh...
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
I do.
Yes, Ed.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
And all the kids stared calling me Pumpkin Ass. Hey Pumpkin Ass
Yeah?
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
A woman wants to be pursued.
They tore her dress! ...
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
Yeah?!
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
Great line.
What if Shari's the dream?
Ed, do you want my advice?
Leave her be.
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
Ed, everything goes off. Cheers went off. Mash went off --
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Ed --
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  Leave her be
Ed --
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
You wanted to see me!
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
I don't think so.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
He's who we want to go with.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Take him off the air.
I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
Good luck.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. The Network Executives Goofiest Moments. And listen, i've really loved working here.
Yes?
Mm...  Oh, man...
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Really? They were..
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Al!
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
We're falling behind.
You know who we are?
Tell me.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Your brother's here.
Adam?!
I'm sorry.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
When? Today?
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Right, right...
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Right.
So he killed himself.
Oh.
Eddie? ...
Yeah?
Are the TV people with you?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Send him away.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No.
No. It's a mess.
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
Hey, he cheated on her.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
How's Marcia? She all right?
I don't know. She's living with that entertainer...
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
Mm.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Oh my God!
I mean, that worked out.
Oh my God!!
I can't believe you're taking his side.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
I don't blame you!
Eve, I'm sorry.
Yes.
Both.
Holy sh--
He had girlfriends!
He says --
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
She could've been a nurse.
She had white shoes.
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
What's the difference?
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him Dad in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
If I don't call you Dad it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
And what did he come back now for?
Who?
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
Eddie...
Mom?
I'm at the hospital.
What's the matter?!
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
St. Joseph's.
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
What happened?
Who?
What?
The doctor said you were having sex.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Oh my god! On TV!
Why? How...
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Ed! How did you know I was here?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Ma...
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
I'm leaving, too.
But, Eve, I would--
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
What's going on over there?
Right, yeah --
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
Hi. Is Shari here?
What is she, at work?
Well, when will she be back?
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
I can't?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
All right. Let them decide.
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
Our what?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's Star Search. You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life...
Eve?!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What?
Goodnight!
What does this mean?
He's just ... trying a little too hard --
How much less?
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
You batted or you bunted?
Well, then I'm quitting.
Who's in it?
Hey, Lou.
Yeah...
I hear the dog really liked him.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Are you sure about this?
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
So?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Dynamite is dangerous.
Right.
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, Boy Shari looks beautiful. I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
What do you want?!
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Ha!
Okay ...
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Oh... how come?
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
I know first aid!
Well, you had better!!
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh my God.
It's... okay
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Well, when you put it that way.
Leave. Go.
Can't we just --
Go!
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Really?
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Oh God, this is so weird.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
What are you doing?
I missed you.
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
Yeah, well...
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
The what?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
Saturday, I think we should
I wish my stepfather was here.
He could give me some oxygen.
What?
Thanks.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
I know, I ...
Shari, I really like you...
I really like you too...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
... yeah, then, but...
So...?
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Shari...
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Page three of the Post.
Ohh...
A poll. Is Shari Good Enough for Ed? Seventy-one per cent said no.  They hate me!
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other...
Twenty-nine.
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  Is she good enough for Ed? Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Really?
Ed?
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
So?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Come on, let's go.
Where?
Somewhere.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Come on...
I need to talk.
Are you all right?
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - How do they find me she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
...yeah?
It's not their fault.
No. It's your fault.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
No... Could you?
The what?
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
What?
Everybody's someone.
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying oh
Come on.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Is that what you call it?
Sing it to me.
All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live.  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
Kinda'.
It's what I do. I yell Geronimo and jump out of a relationship.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
It's nice.
What do we have to do?
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
What's up?
Where were you?
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my career prospects and I'm playing Risk
You know, that would be like a great thing.
What?
Show business.
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Thumbsucker!
I'm making a tape.
We're excited.
I got your message. Way to go!
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
What?
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
You would do this? You would actually --
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Why do you do that?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say Let me ask you something? Why don't you just ask me?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
No.
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the Ernest movies?
Screw off.
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
I don't know.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
All right.
Yeah?!
Yeah.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
No. What happened?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Ray --
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Oh, Jesus.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
What's the dif --
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Great.
While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
Who is it?
Uh-huh. Adam?
Yes, Eve?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Hi.
You watching the ballgame?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Yeah...
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
We'd better go...
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ...  Next thing I know we're ...
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
You brought the girl!
Please!
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
... Ray?
Yeah.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Look, we gotta talk.
Save it.
Cassie...
Good-bye, brother!
Ray, come an--
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
Come on, Ma.
Let's remember how I got into this. Please
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like We grew up in a small
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Me?! That's you!
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
My pleasure.
It was at least as good as the sky.
Really?  Okay!
Neat. Goodnight!
And each contestant gets one of these.  An I tried to screw a network executive tee-shirt.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Hi, Shari.
Who's --
No problema.  You want a picture?
Hi.
No. Am I supposed to?
It's Ed.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
The whole time? Eighteen years?
What...
Oh, man! So...
So you saw me on TV and you said Hey
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
The pirate ship.
-- That we were doing together. I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - That's too much glue. You're using too much glue.
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
What?... Why?
Thanks... That's ...
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
No.
Sure.
Can I help with anything?
What is? Oh, dinner!
Mm.
Mm.
Ohhh...
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
...I do.
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
Sign here, please.
By the X.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
In love?
Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
My mother's like that.
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
what?
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
He likes it.
Yeah, just --
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
All right.  I'll be back
What d'you got?
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
Larry?
I think we've got a problem.
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
You know what they say about the early bird.
Yes, I do.
Is this because of the radiation?
Nothing.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Tracy.
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Right
NO, that's fine
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Okay, fine. Sure
Thanks for everything.
You bet.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Good luck, Tracy.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
As far as I know, they--
A card?
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
I guess you know why you're here
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we interrogate?
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
Why are you lecturing me?
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
And I think certain older persons like you and your colleague shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Yes?
Looks like today's your lucky day
What do you mean?
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Hello, Mr. M.
Are you all right?
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
I've got to go, now.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
How do I leave here?
I promise.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Good for you.  Good for you
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Sporty.
Where to?
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Yes?
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
What's this?
I want you to do something for me.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
Would you sign it for me?
What a surprise.
Take as much room as you want
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
You'll be fine.
I hope so
You will.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Oh yeah, you bet.
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Hmm?
Oh.  Okay.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
So... what do you have to tell me?
What is it. Tammy?
And when did you do it?
Exactly when?
And how did you get in the school?
Which door?
I don't believe you.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an investment.  These are stock certificates that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Tempus fugit!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulâ•š!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Here?
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
points at the motel.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Still clear?
We'll let it run awhile
Right now?
Three twenty-five.
Sherry... I love you.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
These are wonderful.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No. Sit down.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Then why go there?
Because he must!
Who put you up to this?
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Thought what?
Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
Yeah.
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah.
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Can I sign yours too?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Blow out the candles!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
No kidding!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Well, do we just go on up?!
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
Shit is a French word?
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
...the pipe tobacco.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
Also...stay out of the Adult Bookstore.
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
But, I don't understand.
Well, in that case...of course, son.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes, sir. It's true.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - We give up?
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  No
Uh, I think they have.
Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or nori if you prefer. I love sushi.
I love Lucy!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Really?  Since when?
Right on the button.
That's right?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
She's right?!
1959
Russia.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What's the capitol?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Sorry, that's the largest city.
This must be very new.
Yeah.
It's so small.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I don't think so.
No.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
Yeah?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Not on him.
I'm not wearing his pants.
I just don't want to.
Okay.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
No.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
Almost all of them.
The recovery is very impressive.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
I LOVE THIS!!
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Oh. I see.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
So, did you buy a movie?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Does that work?
Yeah...Seems to.
Good-bye, Adam.
Goodbye.
Bye, Troy!
Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!
What?
Of what?
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
Thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
The sky!!!
Up there!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
How do you do, ma'am.
Good!
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Hello.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Yes, ma'am.
Elbows, Son.
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Dad!
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
I'll go up.
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
Yes, ma'am.
Right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Mom?
Yes?
Yes, ma'am.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Yes, ma'am.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
Are you in trouble, son?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
A psychiatrist?!
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Yes.
Oh, my God!
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  Boy?  Did you say you were a country boy?
Really?
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Well, put it down and come in!
You bet, hon!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
It's time.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
It shuts off automatically.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
No.  They all do.
I never know anymore.
You hear that?!
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
How long will we have to stay down here?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Days??
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Yes, dear!
Home sweet home!
To you maybe.
The locks.
The locks?
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
It's safe.
To go up.
To go up.
No.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
All our friends...
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
Really?
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
How could you?! This is just like home!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
I told you! I've got everything!
Oh, no.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Honey?
Is there a problem?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
What shall we call him?
No.  I think it's just right.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yes!
If I...you know...
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Why?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Yes.  Well... yes.
What?
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Hi.
Calvin!
Coming!
Get the presents and do the lights.
You bet.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
What did you wish for, Adam?
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Well, we did in my family!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Let's eat our cake.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
If we still have one.
Yes...
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Would you excuse me?
In the generator room again?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Should we say a little prayer first?
Just open the door.
Yes, yes it is!
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...good.
Yes! That's right!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Mutants?!
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
No.
Yes.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We do?
Yes.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
I want him to at least see the sky!
--do as I say!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
How long will you set it for this time?
I thought ten years.
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Some time.
What are you doing here?
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Stop it, you two!
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
I knew you'd like him.
Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Oh, yes.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Give me your hand.
Oh, my God...
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
I don't know.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
You're serious, aren't you?
Well, that's blunt!
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
Alright, I will.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Well, what do you think?
I think...it...works.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
No.
He's from Alaska.
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for sweet.
Um... Eve?
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Go to the bathroom.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Uh..he might of.
What's that mean?
We did not leave together.
What's it to you?!
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
To bed.
To bed?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
Yes, you do.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Uh, yes, you do.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Where did he get all that information?
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
He left with Sophie.
What?!!
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
You're goddamn right I am!
I don't think so.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Oh, no!
Gay.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
Fallout shelter.
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
We'll find him.
What's wrong?
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
Have him committed.
Yeah! That's thinking.
He was always so nice! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! Nice is weird! Nice is...what is nice? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
I don't know. I like to think so.
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
We came back to the house!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Come on.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Adam!!
Stop!
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Kate Reynolds...
Her assistant?
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
No...
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Hello?
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
Is that tonight?
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
I don't know.  Maybe...
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Why Jack?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Mr. Mintz.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
You have kids, Jack?
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
A broker? Really. And now youÃ†re in the tire business?
ThatÃ†s right. And auto supply...
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
Really. So youÃ†re projecting what, a tad over two million?
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
IÃ†m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
ItÃ†s okay, Alan. I get it. IÃ†m in your shoes, IÃ†m thinking exactly the same thing...but hereÃ†s the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, itÃ†s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyÃ†re gonna send their kids to college.  ItÃ†s just people...
And I know people.
IÃ†m sure you do...
Take you, for instance...
What about me?
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. YouÃ†re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
...thatÃ†s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Seven.  Really.
Good for you. Why shouldnÃ†t you protect whatÃ†s yours.
I donÃ†t think youÃ†re hearing me.
Oh, IÃ†m hearing you, Alan. ThatÃ†s not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I donÃ†t care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and donÃ†t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
Jack, are you okay?
WhatÃ†s going on here?
ItÃ†s not good.  Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. WeÃ†re not sure which one, JuliaÃ†s on it right now. Word is theyÃ†re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  The Global people are up in arms.  They say we shouldÃ†ve been prepared for this.  WeÃ†re in trouble here, Jack...
Excuse me?
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Ã´Art of WarÃ¶ tricks?
No.
YouÃ†re jumping, sweetheart...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
WeÃ†re almost done here...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
ThatÃ†s right.  Okay, letÃ†s make a quick stop at the kidsÃ† shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then IÃ†ll run into the linen store...
FightingÃ†s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
IÃ†m not worried, Mom. HeÃ†s still learning our ways...
This isnÃ†t my real life. ItÃ†s just a glimpse...
WhereÃ†s my real dad?
I donÃ†t know...
They did a pretty good job.
Who did?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Do you like kids?
On a case by case basis...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I think I could figure it out.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Sure.
This is day care.  ItÃ†s where babies go when their parents are at work.
Check...
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Five thirty.  Okay.
Try not to be late because kids donÃ†t like to be the last one picked up.
Got it.  Good tip.
Bye...
Where do I go now?
Big EdÃ†s.
ThatÃ†s where you work.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Like what?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
DonÃ†t you think thatÃ†s a little gimmicky?
Mom liked it.
Maybe thereÃ†s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
ThatÃ†s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Right.  ThatÃ†s a major oversight...  So if IÃ†m Kate...I canÃ†t really afford the finer things, my husbandÃ†s career is a crushing disappointment to me, IÃ†m trapped in suburbia...
Very nice. What is it?
What are you doing?
Ringing my bell...
Is it morning yet?
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  ItÃ†s throwinÃ† everybody off.  What do you think?
Great room...
Maybe I donÃ†t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
IÃ†m having kind of a bad day.
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
What am I saying?  You donÃ†t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thatÃ†s all.  Is that you?
Is it...?
Trouble at work?
I donÃ†t think so.
ItÃ†s not Kate, is it?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnÃ†t the life I dreamt about.  WhereÃ†s the romance, whereÃ†s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you canÃ†t have...
ItÃ†s just two kids, right?
Damn...
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for godÃ†s sake!
WhereÃ†s your follow through?  WhereÃ†s your stance?
Hey, IÃ†m doing the best I can...  IÃ†d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
YouÃ†re right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
Hey Jack, youÃ†re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She is relentless.
She wants to have an affair with me.
Pretty much.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
So could you write down her exact address?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  YouÃ†re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
IÃ†m telling you, those rules donÃ†t apply to me, Arn.
Screw the rules.  IÃ†m talking about the choice.
Hey, is that really necessary?
All IÃ†m saying it there isnÃ†t a guy in Union County who wouldnÃ†t give his left nut to be married to Kate...
So Jack, itÃ†s your wifeÃ†s birthday, got anything to say to her?
ItÃ†s your birthday? Today?  WhatÃ†s your name?  Where were you born?
Hey, you canÃ†t park that thing here.
We bowl together. WeÃ†re bowlers ...we won a championship...weÃ†re winners.
I never won anything in bowling.
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  YouÃ†re doing well...
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldÃ†ve been really good friends...
WhereÃ†s my car?!  WhereÃ†s my Ferrari!?
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itÃ†ll be returned!
IÃ†ve got all the time in the world...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, weÃ†re a mom and pop operation, weÃ†re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Yes you do...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Damn, you are the real thing...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
I call all you white guys Jack.
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
Hey...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Everyone needs something.
Yeah?  What do you need?
Me?
You just said everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
Miss me, Jack?
ThatÃ†s my car!  You stole my car!
ItÃ†s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Basically, itÃ†s my car now.  Get in.
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
What the hell is happening to me?!
Look, I donÃ†t know what youÃ†re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
Brought what on myself?! I didnÃ†t do anything!
No?  CÃ†mon, Jack...IÃ†ve got everything I need, I donÃ†t have regrets, thatÃ†s just not for me... sound familiar?
You mean because you thought I was cocky IÃ†m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  YouÃ†re making a business deal...
Give me my goddamn life back!
You?  What about me?  IÃ†m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Please.  Just tell me whatÃ†s happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
ItÃ†s a glimpse, Jacko.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of Ã¦em take a couple seconds...  ...some of Ã¦em take a lot longer...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
How much time?!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now whatÃ†s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  LetÃ†s talk turkey!  How much money...?
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesnÃ†t work like that and I canÃ†t tell you why.
Why not?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
ThatÃ†s it?  ThatÃ†s all I get?!  A glare?!
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
WhatÃ†s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
But what do I do?
Look Jack IÃ†m late.  IÃ†d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
CÃ†mon, Jack...
IÃ†ve got kids, IÃ†m going home...
You know what the word glimpse means, J? ItÃ†s by nature an impermanent thing.
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
What're you talkin' about?
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
ItÃ†s lovely...
I donÃ†t think so, thank you...
Evelyn, right?
Something like that.
YouÃ†re a nurse?
Are we...?
Is there something going on between us?
It would help me if we were.
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Thanks.  To you too...
Frank.  WhereÃ†s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Look, I donÃ†t know whatÃ†s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Maybe youÃ†re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Thank you.
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
ThatÃ†s the kind of thing you can really build on...
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
Well, IÃ†m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
Why donÃ†t you let me take this one, Kenny?
HowÃ†d you do this year, Tony?
What are you talking about?  ItÃ†s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
All in one tape?
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
I have a bad feeling about this.
About the plane? What do you think itÃ†s gonna crash? DonÃ†t say that...
I know weÃ†ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
DonÃ†t  go, Jack...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Right, for us. But...IÃ†m afraid that if you get on that plane...
What?
Go. IÃ†m sorry, you should just go...
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
You hear me complaining about that?
Are you okay?
Yeah...fine.
What kind of man does that!?
I donÃ†t know!  Please stop yelling at me!
Where were you?
I was in the city.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Because thatÃ†s where I live.
Look, you donÃ†t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
You look forward to this party all year.  WhatÃ†s with you today?
Trust me on this Kate.  I really donÃ†t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
What are you doing?
Why not?
Because youÃ†ll be here.
Funny, Jack.  IÃ†m laughing on the inside.
Yes, IÃ†m fine.  ItÃ†s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Uh huh...
Pro bono.  You donÃ†t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
YouÃ†re kidding me...
SheÃ†s your dog, Jack.
No, sheÃ†s not.
Fine, sheÃ†s the kidÃ†s dog.  LetÃ†s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
But itÃ†s twenty degrees outside...
YouÃ†re having a bad day, IÃ†ll go with you...actually, thereÃ†s no way in hell youÃ†re gettinÃ† me back out there...
Hello!
...my feet are hurtinÃ†...
HEY!
Uh...that babyÃ†s crying...
And...?
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Well thatÃ†s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
Hey!  I was watching that!
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
IÃ†m working on a new deal now...
Wait a second.  You want me, donÃ†t you?
That is the general idea, yes...
ItÃ†s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youÃ†re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We donÃ†t have time for wining and dining.
Whatever you say...honey.
Thanks, Jack...
No, IÃ†m serious...youÃ†re really stunning...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, thereÃ†s no question about that.  But this...  ...youÃ†ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
How can you do that?
Do what?
Look at me like you havenÃ†t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
ItÃ†s an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  IÃ†m gonna buy it...
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  CÃ†mon, take it off.  WeÃ†ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
No?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Excuse me?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if IÃ†m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...IÃ†m sick of it.
Really.
WhatÃ†s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
ItÃ†s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
I canÃ†t believe itÃ†s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldÃ†ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Look, IÃ†m sorry.  IÃ†m sorry I was such a saint before and IÃ†m such a prick now.  Maybe IÃ†m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Maybe youÃ†re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnÃ†t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thatÃ†s what itÃ†s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kidsÃ† college fund.
Well...Annie for one.
Surprise.  WeÃ†re pregnant...  Yeah...that mustÃ†ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
I think it worked out okay, donÃ†t you?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Good, Jack.  Maybe weÃ†ll keep her.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnÃ†t we?
You canÃ†t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldÃ†ve happened if you hadnÃ†t stepped in at the store.
Our life in a nutshell...
If you want to look at it that way...
How would you look at it?
How was the game, honey?
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, whereÃ†s that chocolate cake...?
You mean this chocolate cake?
ThatÃ†s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
CÃ†mon.
Sorry, Jack.  ItÃ†s too important to me.
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
ItÃ†s good, right?
What...?
CÃ†mon, you know what I like to hear...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Oh yeah, youÃ†re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...IÃ†m gonna take you to that special place...
Nice, Jack.  YouÃ†re sweeping me off my feet.
What? You make me hot...
Jack.
Wait a minute.  YouÃ†re my wife?
I found it at an outlet store.  I know itÃ†s a knock-off, but I think itÃ†ll look great on you...
Zeena...
You really are incredible...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
HereÃ†s the thing.  I really hadnÃ†t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversaryÃ†s good all day...
I know that, but...
IÃ†ll fix it.  IÃ†ll go out right now and get you something.  IÃ†ll make it right.
Jack...can we afford all this?
WhatÃ†s the difference? IÃ†m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
How do you even know about this place?
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
But IÃ†m gettinÃ† close, right?
I need to tell you something.
I think it may help us but thereÃ†s a slight chance it could make things worse.
Are you sure?
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
Worse, you mean...
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
And now...?
I think itÃ†s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  ItÃ†s very human.
But you always seem so certain.
ThatÃ†s a big one for me, too.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youÃ†ve seen my pay check.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
ItÃ†s wonderful...
Good things...
What are you sure about?
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
IÃ†m out of the doghouse?
YouÃ†re so...beautiful...
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
ThatÃ†s all I wanted to hear...
I could stay here forever...
Pretty incredible, isnÃ†t it?
Think bigger.
For the week?
This place is a perk, Kate.
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
YouÃ†re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Are you out of your mind?
IÃ†m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
This is New York City, itÃ†s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arenÃ†t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I canÃ†t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnÃ†t want to raise the kids here?
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Jack.
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
DonÃ†t do that...
Look, youÃ†re making this into something itÃ†s not. This isnÃ†t a referendum on our lives, Kate. ItÃ†s a step forward...  DonÃ†t you see?  IÃ†m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
ItÃ†s been interesting, thatÃ†s for sure.
But IÃ†ve done some good things too, havenÃ†t I?
YouÃ†ve been Jack Campbell.  And thatÃ†s always a good thing...
Are you okay, Jack?
Please, just promise me youÃ†ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you donÃ†t, then itÃ†s like it never happened and I donÃ†t think I could live with that.
I promise, Jack...
Promise me again...
Kate...
Jack...God, itÃ†s been so long...You look...
You look great.
ItÃ†s good to see you...
I'm sorry...
WhatÃ†s going on?
IÃ†m moving to Paris...it was right here...  ItÃ†s a box marked Ã´Jack.Ã¶  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Paris?
YouÃ†re moving...
To Paris. Paris, France.
ThatÃ†s the one...
So youÃ†re not at a non- profit firm?
YouÃ†re not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
You canÃ†t go!
Jesus, Jack...
DonÃ†t get on that plane!
Jack.
Please. LetÃ†s just go have a cup of coffee. ThatÃ†s all IÃ†m asking for. IÃ†m sure thereÃ†s another flight to Paris tonight.
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Mrs. Peterson.
ItÃ†s because IÃ†m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, IÃ†ll be fine...
A shelter?!  IÃ†m the richest guy in the building...IÃ†ve got twice the square footage you have!
And God love you for it.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Where is he?
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Not by a long shot.
But youÃ†re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
YouÃ†re a little tougher, Peter.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. YouÃ†re a scotch man, single malt, not because itÃ†s trendy but because youÃ†ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
For the money, theyÃ†re hands down the best radial we carry...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Damn...damn...damn...
No...IÃ†m not...
IÃ†m sorry, no...
Of course I did.
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
I want to see you again.
Tonight.
So we'll get egg nog.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I've got plenty of places to go.
If it's something you feel strongly about.
ThatÃ†s totally see through...
Christmas?  It canÃ†t be Christmas...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
You didnÃ†t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
Yes!
I found it!
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
You did what?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
But now it's free, right?
Yeah.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Well did you or didn't you?
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
No, thank you.
Will it hurt?
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
...So he says to me, you'll never find another man like me...I said, please
You threw him out?
My parents were divorced.
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  divorce is the sister-in-law of death.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Do I look like I have someone special?
Well, there's nobody special!
Fine.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
What?
Meeting ... people.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. So
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts...
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
Really?
Yeah!
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
No really..I can't.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and him... She didn't even look at him.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
You're surprised!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Most men are.
Why this is outrageous!...
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
What are you, out of your mind!
Yep! Right on it!
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
I'm sorry.
I was attacked.
What!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Oh my God... What did they do!  My God!!!
No, I'm fine... really...
You're all right... you sure...
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... Booooorring!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
Can I have my desk please.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
You're calling Lydia in my office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
...Forget it... Goodbye!
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
The moron?
He's not a moron.
And who's Lydia?
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  Will you please!
I... You're not going to understand this.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
He just needs some clothes?
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
Thank you very much.
What are you two up to?
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
What do you think?
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, some matches are made in heaven
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
You were great. Thanks alot.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
My agent.  I called my agent.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
Whoah!  Oh, honey, that's terrific!
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
You made coffee?... You're going back to work and you made coffee?... I love this!
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
Thanks.
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
... What?... You don't want to commute?
No, it's not... Come here...
What?
I'm an incredible woman?  What is this, a death sentence?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
No... it's just...
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as we go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except time?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
No.
No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
What have you been doing here!  Huh! I wanna know!  What have you been doing here?!
Listen!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Parry?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
What if I was a relative?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic yuppie gathering holes.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
Yeah, Edwin, sure... and Pinnochio is a true story... Edwin!  Wake up! This is a fairytale...
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Uh... basement I think...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Tragedy?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Remember. One chorus and out.
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
It was a crime.
Yes... I... I agree...
No...No please...!
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
How un-sixties of you.
I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE AND THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT...
Hello Lydia?
Yeah?  Who is this?
Yes.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Huh-huh.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Which ones?
All of them... Which means you have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Your name was picked.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
A list.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well there....  What's the difference?
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
No!  I told you! You won a contest!
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
So how do we do this?
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Now what?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Free?
Yes.  They're free.
How much?
Well, since you're a member, we could...
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Tonight!  How's tonight?
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Please don't hurt me?
OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
Great place huh?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
No... thanks... Listen --
My name is Parry.
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They're --  -- What?
Where -- ?
What!?
What?!
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
The Little People?
I'm the one what?
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
... Do you know who I am?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
A quest?
But I need help and they sent you.
The Little...
They work for Him.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not any One...
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
But I can't get it... He's...
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Parry... I'm Jack.
I know...
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
I'm not married.
Funny -- you look married.
Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee....
Parry!
Do you follow her every day?
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
I don't know.
Why did you do that?
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
Fifty dollars?
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
That's O.K.
Can I take you to lunch?
No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
What are you doing?  Give that back!
But I gave it to you!
Well what am I gonna do with it?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
Will you shut-up!!!
I'm not. Believe me. I'm scum.
You're a real honest to goodness good guy.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a fly on shit...
That's why the Little People sent you. Just like magic.
So what? You going to help me?
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
You're totally gone, aren't you?
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
SAW WHO!!?
The Red Knight!
The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
Parry...
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Who?
Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
It's such a great song.
It's a classic.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
Yes. I think that's very fair.
.....What are you doing?
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
Who are you talking to Jack?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Bingo!
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, You shall be the guardian of the Grail
Parry, you don't have to earn a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Sure...
Holdin' my penis...
Parry!  Close your pants...
Will you stand still so I can do this!
In a bar called Hellfire.
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
I'm still scared.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Beautiful night huh?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
Fag..a fag you say!?... Curst wolf! Thy fury inward on thyself Pray and consume thee!
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
I advise you to let us go.
You're out numbered son.
Nothing! They can do nothing! Gentlemen!
Are you all right?
You won't be alone for long.
Parry Parry?
No just Parry.
Oh...like Moses.
How about the Hell Merchants?
I don't like horror movies!
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's The Purple Bread
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Got any Ethel Merman?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
What a gyp.
Yeah.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
It sounds exciting.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
How do you know him?
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
Don't say that.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
Well, it's enough for me.
You don't have to say that.
I never say anything I have to.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
I don't drink coffee...
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Excuse me...
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
You're married.
No.
Divorced.
No, I...
You have a disease.
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
Shhh...
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
God I admire you.
Comanche Indian.
You're kidding.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
What?
Oh, thanks.
Maybe tonight?
That's what he said.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Creasy, how old are you?
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Not luck. They don't want me.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
It was planted on me, sir.
You can't keep me here.
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
My God, you're serious.
Can I ask anybody now?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Not a prayer.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Thank God, the police.
Yes.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
That's Babar.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
I don't know. I don't have any.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Mrs. Smith.
Right.
Margaret.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
So what do you figure?
No idea.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
For sure?
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Fletch...
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, donÃ†t you?
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
Affirmative.
Thought so. What for?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
You don't have a piece of the action?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
You find the source?
Gum thought Brazil.
Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Nothing. They're still there.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Where am I?
I'm fine.
Can I get you something?
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Oh my God!
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Here you are, Doctor.
Thank you.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
That's it?
That's it.
I guess not.
He'll be so relieved.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
My lawyer was a bum.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Are you serious?
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attachÃš cases.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
Whoops.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Harry S. Truman?
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, I'm fully covered.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Come on in.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Ten days ago?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Since he moved to L.A.
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Has he?
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Then he has.
Course he has. That's his wife.
He sighs.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
You sure did.
Right.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
What are you doing here?
No problem.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Hi Gummy. HowÃ†s the eye?
I know.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
I'm the Sufi.
Fletch?
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Sure you did.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Twenty years.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Yeah. Maybe.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
We can't talk about it here.
Why not?
Because we can't.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Alan Stanwyk.
Charmed.
Who?
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Come inside.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
Why don't you try suicide?
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
I'm still here.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I have the same problem with my help.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
In this drawer....
A .357.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Do you have a passport?
Sure, all drifters do.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
They serve dinner on the flight?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
You sure those doors will be open?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
That's right.
You sure got the hard part.
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
Will you kill me?
Sure.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Deal.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Don't say shoot, okay.
Did you hear something?
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Spot right here.
Thanks.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
You've met her?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
No, thank you.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John Ultrarelamensky.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
So were my parents.
Please.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Preoccupied with what?
I have this effect on lots of women.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
You are a rich woman.
What's he doing in Utah?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Hi.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
I ordered lunch.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Yes.
Lunch...
I saved his life during the war.
No. He was. I got him out.
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Are you still in love with Alan?
Why'd you let me in?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Good point.
What about his parents?
How come?
Thanks for the great time.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Yeah.
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
That's what I want to know.
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
I'll take you to a game.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
What's wrong, Gail?
No.
I think you better sit down.
I checked. There was no divorce.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
You can't do that.
They're trying to kill me!
You shouldn't be here.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They just left, sir.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Very good sir.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Cabana one.
One.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I would, actually.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I recommend it.
Very good, sir.
You want I set up?
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Muchas gracias.
Sierra del fuego.
Your call is come through.
No wonder.
I commend him on his choice.
I commend him on his choice
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
Where is she?
She moved out?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
So you're saying she moved out.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
I'm her cousin.
Uh, almost.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Two...
Irwin...
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I never read the paper.
...never reads the paper...
What's the spread on the game tonight?
I don't know.  Look!
Looks great.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Why not? Oh shit... really?
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
You broke it? You know the source?
Practically.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Who?
How gray?
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Gummy and two cops...
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
You're onto something. That's good. What?
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
How could you call him?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
Get out of here.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
You'll have it.
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I want something I can print!
Print this Frank.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
What?  Who the hell are they?
What...
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Forget it.
Fletch, you want an apology?
You were going to can me, right?
Not really.
I was upset.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
My secretary.
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Please.
Who's your decorator?
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Now that we've broken the ice...
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Excuse me?
Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Oh... I have some questions.
I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Nuthin'.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
So you...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
I'll do my best.
Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Did she tell you anything?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
But I am...
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
That was close...
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Thanks, I needed that.
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
Great pipes.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Exactly.
You wish.
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
I do it for love.
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make Crocodile Dundee three.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
Spooky.  I'll process her.
Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
You going to be okay?
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
How'd you get this from her?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Make eye contact when you say that.
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
Contacts.
I like.
I don't know, what was the case?
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Yeah, let's bury her.
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
You okay?
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Who?
Ah, an obvious choice.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
I came to warn you...
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
Aha, just what I suspected!
You're not funny.
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Johnny's C.D.?
What an interface!
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
Wha --
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
How much?
You gave it to the girls for one.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
Fluck you!
It's red, Ford.
What?
Hello?
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
You okay?
Let's get serious...
Why are all these people after me?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... Omigod!
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
Spunk, come back...
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Because I know rock-n-roll.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
What a perv...
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
People still watch that?
Zuzu, wake up...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Are you okay?
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
My axe!
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Ye-ah.  Sure.
This is boring, guys.
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
Ford, you were right!
Ye-ah.
I'm afraid so, you want her?
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Nice left you got there, jerk.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
This way...
No, wait...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Ye-ah.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Forget French.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because everyone else was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
Pretty smooth, huh?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see Batman
Why have you come to my planet?
Ick.
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
I can't kill this kid's father...
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Are you okay?
There's that question...
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Gut feeling.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... hey!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Ouch.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Twelve pack?
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Did he just say what I think he said?
I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
You need it.
I don't need it that bad.
I'm sorry...
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
I tried to help you...!
And hey, I appreciate it...
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
So, did you find my dad?
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Yeah, go on...
It's me.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
Who's my real father, man?
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Shut the heck up... Pop.
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Really?
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Fine!
I'm off it!
The case!
I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy. In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
Say cheese...
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and now I get to die!
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Jazz, we're talking here.
Go on, another time, another place.
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
Shock.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture you, Ford.
It doesn't have to be like this?
Oh God, please, don't!
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at THE Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
What about Don?
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Kill them.  Not quickly.
Are you okay?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Ciao.
You'd said something about proof...
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Fuck me...
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
When I was young, I read Billboard and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I cut my fucking ears off so I'd only hear my music. Here, look.
I'm still the king!
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Only on a first name basis.
That's funny, you're cute.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Hey, the poet...
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
It is to us!  It's computerised.
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
How nice.
'Bye, Johnny...
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Better call an ambulance first.
Is that all you found?
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
...And I said, shut up!
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
Uh...yes.  But...
Okay.  There's one.
It's just beginning.
So what are ya drawin'?
No.
'Cause it stinks.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Will you listen, dammit!
Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
There's no time for this bullshit...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
I've seen it.
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Please don't do anything crazy.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
Very big.
What did you find?
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Crosstown.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
We must abandon.
Do not inhale.
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
That's where I peed.
Guys ready to order?
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Elliot?
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Say it again.
Alla puttanesca.
I don't want to hear about it.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
Quietly effective.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Press a button and they give us money.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
Very dangerous.
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
Do not inhale.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
What do I exude?
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Tonight. What's tonight?
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
It's just a review.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
What happened eighteen months ago?
And he was there?
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
That's awful.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
What was it like?
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
Is it safe?
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
I'm not ready.
Here we go.
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Where are you going?
Don't wait Efor me.
What about the haircut?
He carries a gun.
Then you should carry a gun.
Where is it?
That was a big mistake.
We're making too much of this.
No, we're not.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
It's your best play, Nicky.
He'll hate it.
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
What?
Shoot him.
How do you Eknow.
Paisley Porter.
What do you mean?
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Had to be him.
She was very evasive.
Great game.
Classic.
What are you talking about?
Yes. What are you implying?
Of course I saw it.
You're not making sense. Make sense.
I hear Alan's sick.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
You know about Adele.
What about her?
She died.
I talked to her two days ago.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Our Peter?
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
Can he get through it?
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
About what?
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
What?
The Red Sox
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
It can't be all that personal.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
We're able to surprise each other.
In and out of bed.
Because we're completely mismatched.
We don't even like each other, do we?
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
It's your best play, Nicky.
They'll lose because they're my team.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Do you want to get some coffee?
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Why do you need a radio?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
That's completely crazy.
Is it?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
She is kicking you out.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
I have a class. I'm late.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I'm not sure.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
What will we talk about?
Everything.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
Why won't you tell me your name?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
Brilliantly moving.
Packs an emotional wallop.
A flat-out hit.
Yes.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
What do we want?
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
See, Daddy.
What else?
Your father said you might be here.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
All right. What's been going on?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
How prominent?
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
I'll have whatever she's having.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
Opening night, Lillian.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
That's always been my problem.
And you've been extremely patient.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I'd forgotten that.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
That's very lovely actually.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Joanne Bourne.
Alma Wetzel.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
She's my gynecologist.
It violates so many trusts.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
Life is good.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
One more out.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
A thousand things.
This could be it!
I'm at the door.
Where the hell are you?
Right here. At the door.
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Get yourself something to eat.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
You know the answer to that.
They're only gonna lose.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.
I can't find it.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
I know, Pop.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
So what are you going to do about it?
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Oh yeah?
Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
How come you got the kid with you?
Matthew's my grandson.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Now that's a complicated subject.
That's a simple subject.
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
It's a complicated subject.
It's a simple subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day.
I want to believe.
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Then say it.
Life is good.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
Matthew.
He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Washed away.
Because faith is rewarded.
Don't worry. It's a test.
This could be it!
Why does it matter?
Why do you care?
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
What about my play?
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
hat was this morning.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
I hate the Mets.
Have to hurry back.
Eleventh inning. What else?
You're not making sense.
What do you mean?
Yes, Peter.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
Mine was cobalt blue.
Yes.
And the Father replies?
This could be it.
What's good?
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
You've worked with Elliot?
There was a review.
So does Elliot.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Oh. You know him.
And he has finer moments now and then.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Endearing.
Engaging.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
A little drastic maybe?
Say it again.
Alla puttanesca.
One more time.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
I hear good things about the new play.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Would you like to meet him?
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is it true?
Is what true?
He wears a disguise.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
Do you think he can do it?
I don't know.
He's a very sweet man.
Home.
Someone waiting for you?
No one's waiting.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Yes.
Never mind.
What? Come on, Paisley.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
He goes to the theater armed.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
I don't want you, Steven.
I'm going home to my machine.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
What color hair does he have?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
Why?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
What does Starsky say?
He says. This is he.
This is he?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Would they do that?
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
She's really kind of hot.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
What do you think the cops have?
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. Things Dignan was not supposed to touch.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
Where are you going?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
How was I ridiculing you?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
It had an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Eight dollars.
That's not bad.
But he didn't say anything.
Hang on a second.
Is it back in?
Just turn right here.
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Nothing. Go ahead.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Dignan, calm down.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Dignan! Stop!
You're right. You're right.
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
Is that the manager?
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Holy shit.
What about what that guy said?
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Like he meant it.
Yeah.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
What do you think?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Don't even say it, man.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
See if mine are in there.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll just say it.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
On your marks...  Get set go.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
True.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
No. We didn't.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
May I have a word with you, please?
Sure.
What the fuck is going on here?
What. What's the matter?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
They don't?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
On the left.
She's from Cuba.
No kidding.
He needs to hire an attorney.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
As long as he gets out OK.
Obviously. That's a given.
Bob?
See, now we've got a plan.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
This was in fourth grade.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
Yes... It's true.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Where was it parked?
Right here.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Maybe he just went to the store.
He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
He went back for his brother.
We said 48 hours.
That's a long time to be in jail.
When'd he tell you?
This morning.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
If you say so.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
OK.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I wish I'd been there.
Would of been nice.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
We need a car.
I have an idea for that.
What?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I don't think we can do that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
She doesn't need to know.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Shh.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
Don't panic, Anthony.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Our money situation is not good.
You're so spoiled. What is not good to you? Only a few hundred --
We've got sixteen dollars.
That's not correct.
Sixteen dollars.
I know.
Where's the rest?
I had to give some to Inez.
How much?
383
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Shut up!
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
When'd you get back?
Ah. Couple days ago.
Who's in the car?
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Sure.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
I want you to look at this.
What is it?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Who's Mr. Henry?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
What time did he say to be here?
You could give somebody a concussion.
Let me feel that.
He seems pretty good.
Dignan. Take it easy.
Get out of the way.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Shit, Dignan.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I'm sorry, Bob.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
OK. Mark that down.
I did.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Next week we'll be drinking piÂ±a coladas.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Did that hurt?
I don't think you will.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
He was a nice guy.
He was all right.
Do you like Inez?
As a person?
Yes. I do.
So do I.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
We all set?
Hang on a second.
Uh-huh?
OK. Roger.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Any activity?
Good. It's supposed to be.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Stand by, Bird Dog.
I don't know.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
What's happening? What's going on?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Applejack! What's happening?
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Careful. Check his pulse.
Who tripped the alarm?
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
Let's go. Come on.
Wait for Kumar.
Come on, Kumar.
You're kidding.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
Come on.
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Dignan, it's too late.
I don't think so.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yes I do.
In the corporate offices.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
I'm Martin Blank.
Wonderful.
Whatever I can get away with.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
He did?
Yeah.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
Bob...
It's me. Martin Blank.
Okay. See you later.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Really?
You could've been a contender, huh?
What do you want to do?
Then express yourself, Bob.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
You think Applejack knew?
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
I just play my own collection.
It's nice to see you again.
How long has it been?
Ten years, I think. What I miss?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Here is now there. There is here.
Tell me about yourself.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
That's it?
Not much else.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Okay.
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Where have I been?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
You see someone?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
Are you going to the reunion?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Yep.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Well, there's not much to tell.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
You met people.
Bad people.
Watched television?
Bad television.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
What's that?
That'd be good.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Yes.
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
Are you there?
Yes.
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
Why?
We're not sure.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
You're fucking psycho.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
As long as I get the laugh.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
...Let me get my coat.
Do you want to get a drink first?
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Right.
Shoulda brought my gun.
What?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Which would you rather...?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
--She's not dead---
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Yes.
No.
Is it something you've done?
It's something I do...
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
...About five years now.
Get the fuck outta here.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain Moral flexibility would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called mechanical operations. We sort of found each other...
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Jesus Christ!
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
I was leaving.
That's probably a good idea.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
I'll hide.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
You kill people.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Other people can't.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
You went to school with these people.
Come on.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
How do you know?
I just know.
Say more.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be withholding... and I know where you live.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, Well
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Yes.
Mmm.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
What stuff?
You're living on a sailboat?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Oh, I'd say about --
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
What else? Say more.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
This is me breating.
I work alone.
You understand the psychology of the job.
No.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Okay.
Up on the right.
What do you want?
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Thank you, no.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Where?
Behind Bob's house.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
No harm no foul.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
Hard to get good help these days.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
I didn't get into this business to have associates. And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. Loner--  Loner gunman. Get it? On my own. That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Is that right?
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
There you go. I left it blank.
Excellent. Here they come.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Not bad. You?
Hey, Bob.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Does it float?
Those all seem kind of related...
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
I guess.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
Lisbon?
In Portugal, yes.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
I don't think so.
--Nooo--
--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
That's strictly BÃ“ader-Meinhof stuff.
It was the PLO.
Whatever.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
I love. I kill.
So how is it in there?
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
If he does our job, he's our job.
I get it.
No...
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Patch him through....
Throw that away.
This?
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
All of it?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
That's going to cost.
I'll pay.
They're not happy, sir.
I'm not happy.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
He didn't.
They blame you for the compromise.
And they want me to make up for it.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
They were very upset.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
There's nothing to be done about it.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
Enough?
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
I have scruples. Next.
Don't forget your identity.
See you next week.
This is not good.
What's he in for?
He stole a tractor.
What's it look like?
It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I've looked at it.
You have.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Tell them my house exploded.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
I bought a new rug.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
It's a place where religious people--
Jim?
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
I spoke to your father the other day.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
Yeah. I guess we did.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Of course you will.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
So what happened to you?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Dignan, I --
You too.
Debi's house.
No. You drove us here.
No.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
He sells BMW's?
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
Mein Dealer.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
How did you get this job?
Wow.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How are you? How's business?
How's that?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Why not?
I'm a professional killer.
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Scale the --
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
Thanks.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
Thanks.
Grammar.
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
You mean a safecracker?
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
So do I.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
What do you mean?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
That was a test?
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
That sounds like Dignan.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Me?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
No. Bob did.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Anthony, I'm petrified.
This is good.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Yeah.
It's an esoteric journey.
We're renegades from despair.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Why'd you want to help us?
Future Man.
Who?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Did you ever steal a car before?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Hector woudn't do anything.
Could you grow cinnamon?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Let them fight.
Are you serious?
See you.
See you, Bob.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
What was that?
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Move.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Nobody does.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
OK, Dad.
He looked too shaken-up.
How long are they going to hold him?
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Anthony, I --
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
What?
Is that OK?
Bob, where you going?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
You think I'm improving?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
No, I don't mind.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
No. I wasn't adopted.
Was Future Man adopted?
Jesus Christ! No.
Let's not even talk about it.
It was stupid.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
You OK, Bob?
Nothing. I was just asking.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
What are you doing?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
No.
Jesus, Bob.
Yeah.
Who's got the car keys?
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
It's in the driveway.
Temporarily.
...any sister talk?
Mm-mm!
Oh, good...
Come in, come in.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Mmm?
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
I love that.  That's my type.
I can't believe it!
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crÃ›pes caviar.
Well, let's hope so.
Hi.
Oh.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Yeah.
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
You want to see some?
Oh, yeah.
How do you say nineteen?
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
That's just --
Look at this.
Yeah.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
And then, uh, April...huh?
Great.
I know.  It's terrible!
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Mmm.
We're a big hit.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Oh!
Oh, is that what it is?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Right.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Yeah.
It feels like you're in France.
That's disgusting!
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
It's really terrible.
Yeah.
Oh, geez, yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Uh...
It depends on what way you want to go.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Uh...
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
What?
No, he called late last night.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
And you, you-you're going?
But I'm seeing him.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Were you born in Mexico?
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
We're actresses.
Is this your first job?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Oh no.  Not at all.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
You're Holly.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
What makes you think we're more interesting?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Oh, what, what do you do?
I'm an architect.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's terrific!
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Uh-huh.
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite.
God, yes. Like silk.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
Yeah.
They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
And it ruins everything else.
It does.
Fast.
Well...
We could...we could do that.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
This time I really think I have something.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Mm-hm.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Now I ca-can't remember.
Let's take a look.
What?  What?
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
Really?!
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
When did you first notice this?
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
And it's just in one ear?
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Like what?
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Could you--
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
We--
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Oh, great.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Like, uh...?
I don't know exactly.
Yeah.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Uh-uh.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
You're out looking here?
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Ohhhh!
How about you?
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Where are you headed?
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Oh, God.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yeah, you would.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Yeah, sure.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
No, I don't have time.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
No!  No...
No?
Yes?
Yes.
Everything's okay?
Yeah.  How are you?
I'm...all right.
How-how's Frederick?
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Abdul-Shabazz?
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, sure.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Well, thanks a lot.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh, yeah.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Oh, that's nice.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Oh, you-you have that one?
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one.
Isn't that beautiful?
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Yes, he's just adorable.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Oh, right.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Did you ever read this one--?
Elliot!  Don't!
Oh!
What are you doing?!
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Elliot!
I have been in love with you for so long.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Oh, don't say those words!
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Why, you know the situation.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Why?
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Poor Hannah.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
The front stairs.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I thought you weren't coming.
I almost didn't.
Lee... uh...
I didn't sleep all night.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
This is not an easy situation.
I know it isn't.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Oh, my God.
Oh, all the time.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
No.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
But it hasn't been forever.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
And you're in love overnight?
Lee...
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
They're fantastic.
Aren't they great?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
I know!  I know!
She has all the cooking talent.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
I know.
That's where your talent lies.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
Mmm.
You bet.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Was I?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Why not?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
I don't know.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
I want one with you.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Wait a second.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Are you angry with me?
No!
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
I didn't say that.
Are you in love with someone else?
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Are you?
What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
Get his wine away.
That's Anthony.
Yeah.
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
I am... I did slave all day.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
It's on the table, Dad.
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Let go!
You set me up.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
Mom, come out!
Want some coffee or tea?
How about something to eat?
No, nothing.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Mmm...
Hmm?
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Because he likes you.
Me?
Yeah.
Elliot lusts after you.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
...or films you must see or...
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
They're in the basement.
I don't sell my work by the yard!
Oh, Frederick!
What's the problem?
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
Like what?
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Why?
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
No.
Oh, yes, you have!
No.
You've been with someone!
Stop accusing me!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
I'm sorry.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
I'm saying it now!
So you met somebody else?
Yeah.
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
Who is it?
But who?  Where did you meet him?
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Oh...
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
True.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
You know...
No--
Yeah?
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Hello?
Like--
But not you.
Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Well, he has to rule out certain things.
Like what?!  What?
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
But you don't have any symptoms!
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
It was on your shirt!
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
Bob! Get back in position!
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Yeah.  What?
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Yes, please.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
No.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Yes!
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
I think they're fantastic.
Okay.
Oh, great.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Oh, yeah?
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Why?
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Are you a fag?
So how are you?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
No.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
How are you?
I'm okay.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Y-yeah.
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Really?
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh...
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Oh, now--
She's going through a really rough time right now.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
Yeah?
I think we need to eat.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
Hi!  Hi!
I know...I know.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
I got two minutes.
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Huh?
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
The one and only Little Richard.
How is everything?
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
He's fine.
Yeah?
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Oh!
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I think so.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?
Ohh!
I know, I know.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
That's really nice!
...you know?  I, uh...
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Mh-hm.
That's a beauty!
Isn't that great?
Go right over there.
Football!
Wow!
Gee.
Is there no chance?
Well, then a third opinion.
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Well, what about artificial insemination?
What are you talking about?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
What, by a st-stranger?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
I want to experience childbirth.
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
Well, what do you think?
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
...from Mavis, also.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Now, Holly's not shy.
True.
No, no, we decided!
Perfect!
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Oh, sure.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Not even for emergencies?
No.
They are.
So who's going to know?
My brother.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Two thousand dollars.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Okay.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
Ohh?
Uh-oh.
Yeah.
Don't you think she does?
She really does, though.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Frederick didn't come with her.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
It's, uh, you never know--
He's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
That never would of --
Let's cut the bullshit.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Ouch!
Oh!
Well, how about this?
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Sometimes she's terrific...
Oooo.
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
You found all this, all this out on one date?
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Singing?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Ohh!
You know.
I know, no--  I know.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Easily.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Yeah.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
I hope.
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Look, everything's going your way.
Hey, hi!
Well, I just came from an audition...
So what's new?
Boy--
Oh, what do they know?
Oh, God...
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
You stole a Trans-Am.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
It's true, Dignan.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
I'll just drive my car.
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Well-well, like what?
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Yeah, that's clerical.
No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
Yeah, you mean not at my age.
You treat me like a loser.
How?
You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
Hmm!
Uh, losers!  All losers!
You're too demanding.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
What's the matter?
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Good.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Hey, what's the matter?
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
My script?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Oh, so loosely.
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
You want some?
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Can we, can we go?
No!
My--uh...
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
I was so bored!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
Yeah.  Me, too.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
God!
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
I remember you.
Yes, you do recall, right?
I recall you.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Yeah.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
We didn't hit it off.
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
How are you?
Good.  How are you?
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Yeah?
It was a terrible evening.
Yeah, it was.
Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a...
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Good question.
I'd never do that.
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
People change...you know.
Well, I hope you've changed.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
...namely a personality.
So how are you?
I'm okay.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Well...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
Probably not.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Have you?
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, you can tell me.
Come on.
No, I am.  I am.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, Hey
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
No, the reason I ask is--
You've always hated my taste in the past.
No, I haven't.
You have.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
You're okay, though, huh?
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Hmm.
Yeah.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
Really?
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Well, what about me?
Oh, well.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Really?
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Right.
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
Oh, God!
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh, wow!
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Oh, who cares?
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
Oh, yeah?  What?
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
It's all right.
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I--
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Hi.
Hi.  How you doin'?
When'd you get here?
Just a few minutes ago.
Thanks.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Mmm, what?
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Mm-hm.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
God.
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
I told you he's crazy.
Yeah.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Where are the antihistamines?
Oh...
Dad!
Hi.
...which I did not get.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
April?
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Hmm.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Why are you so upset?
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Uh-huh.
The guy is fucking insane.
I warned you, Dignan.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
Where'd she go?
Let's just go.
I'm going to take a look at this.
That's my responsibility.
That's your domain.
OK.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I paid for it.
God DAMMIT.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
He electrocuted someone?
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
His name was Swifty?
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
That's too bad.
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
What are you doing?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
What happened?
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.
Did we get it?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
How much is there?
No. I was calm.
You really think he'll remember you?
Now what? What did I do this time?
I don't want to talk about it.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
No.
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
Howdy Pouty.
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, I'm going to remember you!
Bob, I've got nightmares.
You're all making me blush...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
Goodnight, Jasper.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
Way to go, Bob!
I told you they were there.
So it's my fault?
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
I'm not a nai-ive little...
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
There were more than that.
This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!
Yeah. And?
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
I just never thought of you in that...
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
He wouldn't move.
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
What in the hell did you do that for?
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
That's not what I was worried about.
Hey.
Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Yeah. I guess I do.
Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
I think your passion is terrific.
I think your condescension is even better.
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
Do you really not believe in God?
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
What else don't you believe in?
Talking while kissing.
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
Iunno. I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I almost did something.
When were you in Niagara Falls?
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
Is he chasing us?
I don't know.
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Don't worry, you...
Fuck off.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Probably.
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Do you really think I care?
Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week. My mom says it's okay that I stay overnight at your dorm...It'll be nice to see you in                          ] a different shirt.                                          ] ] WICHITA                                            ] Oh, I didn't tell you. I wear this                          ] all year round. The chicks dig it...                        ]
Not now, Wendy.
This isn't about doing it. I just think we need to talk some things out privately before...
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
What do you want me to say?
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you deliberately                        ] destroyed us!

Shut the fuck--!
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Don't get cocky, girl.
Shoot.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
Bob. Are you coming?
It's not my style, okay?
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
You're beautiful.
Oh, I have to hear this.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
All right.
My brother's in jail.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Because you're an idiot.
All right.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Because you're an idiot.
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Something like that. Will you do it?
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
I'll think about it.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
The weed.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
They said he's a drug dealer.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Geez, don't listen to them.
Never say never.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
You goddamn bitch!
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
That could be anybody's.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Heather? Wha...
What are you doing here?!
Oh, I just had the nicest chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
How long has he been in there?
I don't know.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
We'll have to see when we get back.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
Heather.
Is she dead?
You're not funny. Ouch!
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Don't talk to me like that.
No.
What do you mean get back?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
This could be a trap.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't Come on
Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Yeah, I just got back.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Give me the clipboard.
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Uh-huh.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
What were you trying to do? Sleep?
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Sure.
There are no stupid questions.
That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
How very.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
I didn't. Cherry.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
I don't know. Should you?
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
I don't really like your friends either.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
S'okay....
I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
Killing her won't solve anything.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
Good plan.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
Chick-en.
You're not funny.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
And your worst enemy.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
What are we going to tell the cops? Fuck it if she can't take a joke
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
You might think what I've done is shocking...
To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word myriad.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
She missed myriad on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
You're probably right...People think just because you're beautiful and popular
That's good. Have you done this before?
Mute!
Next channel, darling.
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, Dad?
What is this shit?
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
Do you take German?
French.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Let's go.
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
Incredible similarity.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
It doesn't work on small animals!
Oh.
Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up...
Perrier water!
Oh come on. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Did you miss him completely?
Don't move! I'll get him back!
Remember he's left-handed.
We killed them, didn't we?
Of course.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
I did not want them dead.
Did to.
Did to.
Dignan.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Your son's dead and you love him.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
Can't you see this is a special moment?
I was just making it more special.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Don't even talk about that stuff!
You can be so immature!
You kids are making too much damn noise.
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
Maybe.
We're breaking up. I am out!
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
I could be up for that. I've already started underlining meaningful passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
Come on in. What you been up to?
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
If you'll excuse me......
No-o!
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
You didn't say Simon Says.
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
How do you turn the fucker off?
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school was society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
The bomb, asshole!
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
You know what I want, babe?
What?
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Yeah. It is.
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
I thought I...you..
You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
Maybe. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Maybe.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
Superb.
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Get a job.
That's three things.
But my name's not...
You said 48 hours!
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
All right! Backyard! Right now!
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
Come on!
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I didn't have any choice.
I'm sorry, Bob.
That's OK.
That's OK.
Look. We want you on the job.
Come on, Bob.
Jesus Christ.
Scarecrow?
Yeah?
Everything OK?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
I couldn't hear anything.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
What's wrong with Applejack?
Let's go!
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Take him to the car, Bob.
The elevator broke.
He's stuck between two floors.
Applejack drove.
Run. Run. Let's go.
What's that?
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
Try stupid.
You got a drinking problem or what?
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
I know a guy who only has one leg.
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  Keep a low profile
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
The bathroom!  For two days?
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
Lighten up, John.  You think you got problems for Chrissake?
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Right.
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
It was you!  I thought I heard...
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being around them if you know what I mean.  There you go, you inspire this kid to live.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
Allen?  He... he's okay?
Hold on --
Wait a second --
Now!
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
That's good enough for me.  You better take that letter there and get rid of it.
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
There was this kid there saying, Go in there and save my father
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
What's going on?  Guilty!  What is this?
Anticipation of incarceration?
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
He gives a good report and I walk?
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Often, uh.
How recently?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
It's November.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
The Angel of Flight 104!  You're telling me you're the A...?
Angel!  I didn't say angel
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
That fake inspired you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job twenty-five hundred goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna do time!  You're s'posed to be an attorney for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have good judgment!
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Hey, you could call me Bernie
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
I'm working on it.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Spanish kinda guys!
Business thing.  Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
I didn't even know you had a kid.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a wonderful person instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
Nothin'.
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
Bill, I...
I...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Bill, listen...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
The homeless!
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
Me!
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Yes, everybody is in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
Harassed.  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
He had one tiny, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
Underbelly!
Lie, you mean...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him!
I snuck in.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
This guy, this friend your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
JOEY!
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about truth. Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's your bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?
Uh, er... I...
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Yes.
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
I... I know that, John...
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
You did save my life!  And it's me! I'd be taking advantage of you! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional...  I...
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
No, I don't have the right.  You're a news story!
Uh, right.  A... news story.
Goodnight, John.
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
Gale...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
Bodybuilding!
It's no big deal, it just looks better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
John, I know all about it.
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth.
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
Because he was a real hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when good sense told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, Newswoman Saves Suicide?
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
He said what?
A mystery guy!  Not a passenger. Who?
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
Ticket!  What's going on?
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
I thought they'd all go It's him! It's him! and hug the guy or something.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
He's not supposed to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a real life hero, all he has to do is act like a real life hero.  That's the beauty of the concept, the whole freshness of it.  Did she call him back?
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
How long do you have to go?
And what does that cover?
Hand to hand combat?
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
Never reach out!
Hello, Mister Wallace.
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
You didn't?
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
He's pretty... remarkable.
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
What about?
Who?
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Is he in?
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
What do you mean grammar?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
The grammar?
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Is he good?
He's damn good.
Join the party, fellas.
We're just going over a few things.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Why?
Well, I think --
Who? Applejack?
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
What's the story?
What can we do?
Where's that guy going?
Well, I left some money in there.
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
You got that?
No. I just have short hair.
No, my friend knows her.
Sure.
I don't know.
No. Just pool.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
Right.
Mr. Henry?
It's locked.
The world needs dreamers, son.
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Something like that.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
That was beautiful.
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Gum.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Looks like you've been expanding your...
My next word was gonna be consciousness.  Swear to God... tubby.
That's your definition of Hard?
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
You're not...LISTENING!
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
Cameras?
5:32.  Swinging on a Star.
A mule is an animal with long funny ears.
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught.
And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo.
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Attempted.  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was Who Shot J.R.?
Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
Count of three?
Okay.
Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
Don't worry, we'll get it...
That was close....
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
Alex, are you....
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Too-do-loo, babe.
Yes way.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Ooh-kay...
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Yeah.  The big E.
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
A little petting is not the issue!
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say God go with me.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
That's what you theenk.
Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
Oh, you read that.
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
And I'll bring my entourage...
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Said.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
Prison?
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Wow, you were in the joint. Doing hard time.  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
What have you been doing?
Uh....old badminton injury.
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
Oh, I'm so sorry...
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
It's also been a long time for me.  I--
Catholic girls are scary...
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Oh.  No.
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Wha--
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the gas leak that supposedly destroyed it.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
Hudson, don't you understand...
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Oh.  Well, what's this?
Where did you get this?
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
You re not some guy anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
I hope you know what....
Wha.....
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Wha -- you don't want to know...
I wanna know...
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
I got my planet back.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Cat got his tongue?
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Baseball, why?
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just buy the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
If you're pausing for a thank you
I guess that's a no.
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
You want an address on that last one?
But you're going to tell us anyway...
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
What job?
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to stop me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying Soitinly.
Yes.
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
You certainly do.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police.  You have no proof.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
Alchemy.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
If you think you're getting past me...
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
This is the worst night...
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
Don't be stupid...they...
Just shut up and hit me!
Don't I know you...
To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
Employer?  The president?
Why George, you big softie...
Thanks for sharing.
If you do anything to my friend...
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
Why does this have to be so hard...
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
Well, maybe I --
It's hardly the same --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
I'm plenty happy!
...Hello?
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
A sawbuck!
On Norville Barnes!
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
The couch, please.
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
What a horrible little person.
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
I myself --
Cigarette?
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
Mind if I join you?
You're from Muncie?!
Why yes, do you know it?
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Oh, no, really, I --
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
or lack thereof?
these preposterous inventions; would be better suited to the pages of amazing Tales Magazine. if the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind; perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter!But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. as I doubt also that you could find a home at amazing Tales; a periodical Which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely; Et cetera.
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
I'm sure I --
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Well, I --
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
...You know! For kids!
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
Confused?
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Oh, is that it!
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Smitty.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
...What happened?
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Let me look.
Sid found me the icepack.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
I know that, Amy.
...You do?
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
...Certain people are --
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
...Huh?
You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
You don't say.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Every year?
Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
...The people look like ants.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
What a beautiful thought.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Sure, Norville, sure...
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Never mind about that...
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
You mean you know about this?
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Your i --
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Now, Aim --
Worked in a watch factory?
Consider this my resignation --
...You son of a --
Norville!
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
Oh Norville, I --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
I filed it yesterday.
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
I don't know...
Muncie.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
You can't print that!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Ya know, entry level!
I got big ideas, though!
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
How long've you been down here?
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
I thought you served misfits here!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
I --
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
Well, I --
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
My pleasure, sir.
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
...Why, this is worthless.
Huh?! But, buddy --
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
Yeah, but, buddy --
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
But, buddy --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
But, buddy, you were --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
An example must be made!
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Awwww, buddy --
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
Get up!
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
But, Buzz --
But, Buzz, you know I never --
And Sid says you stole it!
But Buzz --
Norville.
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Oh, geez.
Geez, I --
Sir?
Yes sir...
'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
...This'll only take a moment.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
I haven't had --
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
...Who let you in?
I --
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
I --
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
You --
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Wait a minute!
...education, were you?
Hmmm.
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
No, sir.
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
You're fired.
But, sir! --
Get your feet off that desk.
But --
Oh my God, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
Oh my God, sir!
Not that way! Through the door!
But, sir!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
Oh my God, sir!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
Finally.
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Well... I'm for it...
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Ya don't say.
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
How's that, Sid?
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
Vodka.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Patrick -- is that- a.
Perm?
Now how's your memory doin'?
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Goodbye.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Here's hoping, baby...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
I know about the bachelor party.
Who told you?
One of the accountants.
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
That's right.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
You are not a loser.
Who said anything about loser? Where do you get this word loser?
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Well, no you didn't --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
This can't be happening to me.
Jerry!  Do something --
I just heard.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Oh honey.  It's spun.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Could you just stop moving?
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Look, I don't want a --
It's not love me.  It's not trust my handshake.  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be confusion about that.
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
I think you added the brutal.
-- stop --
Listen to me!
No.
It's over --
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Listen to me, it's over.
No one has ever dumped me.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Oh Jerry.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Wait.  Did I just say hon to him?
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
He's asleep, right?
Wait.  What do you mean?
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Just be friendly and say no comment.
You're imagining it.
... this is... uh... too funny...
Bill, Rod, wait --
Can I help?
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Now what did you lose?
My son... my mind...
Well, thanks.
Well, take care.
Oh no.
No no. I knew.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called my twenties. See you later.
You think so?
Oh tsht. Yes.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
-- the part about we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm --
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Wonder what he said.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said you complete me. _ 40.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
No no, I know --
Absolutely.
That took guts.
Same to you.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Hello?
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
... light.
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
We are?
It's all going to work.
I just got goosebumps.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Happy for us.
Thanks.
Call me later, hon.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Hi.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Oh my God.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Too bad.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Sure --
Beer okay?
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Good idea.  Thank you.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
We will be fine!
And I am...
Truth?
Sure.
Me too.
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Mission... statement...
Well.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit.  You said boss.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
I may not sue.
Well, good evening.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Happy. He said happy?
Actually he said glad. _ 85.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Plus, you could use that commission.
You don't have to explain.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Yeah, what happened there.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I'm relieved you said that.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Oh good.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, it's nobody's fault. It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Maybe you should call her.
No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Good night.
Same to you.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Right.  I'll come in.
Oh hell yes.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
Fine, I just --
Sure you're okay to drive this?
What --
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
If I said that, would you stay?
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Okay... I will...
Why do you love me?
What --
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
Tell me -- let me help --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
I don't need you to stick.
You want...
...my soul or something. _ 117.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
What if it's true?  Great at friendship bad at intimacy. I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
What about Ray?
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
So this break... is a break-up.
Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
Of course I know --
Wait. Where is he?
He's in the living room asleep.
He's coming over.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Dotty -- this is not guy.. This is a syndrome.  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
I heard.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Thank you.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
As opposed to twenty angry women?
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Good.
Forgot your keys --
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
First you gotta tell me something.
No--
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Please, if I start talking --
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
Oh, thank you.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
I'll give it everything.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Said who?  Sugar?
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your my word is stronger'n oak thing --
Okay.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain get killed
Now you want Arizona dollars.
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
Mmm.  Hmm.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Yes.
Here it is.  Show me the money.  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Let's do it again.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
I'm not about love -- I'm about showing you the money.
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Call me tomorrow.
I might call you later!
You love me now, don't you?
Very much.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Huh?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on do not do this day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
No.
You are not allowed to act this way.
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your nya nya nya.
Another drink please.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Oh my God.
Did you tell him about the ten million for four years?
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the coin.  It's the...
the kwan.
That's your word?
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
But how did you get kwan? _ 82.
I got there from coin
Great word.  Towel?
No, I air-dry.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Is that your porty or mine?
You.
You're telling me to dance.
No, I'm saying to be --
Love me love me love me... put me on t.v.  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
What's wrong.
Forget it.  Forget it.
No tell me. _ 84.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
It's a risk.
I'll get you some quick work --
Good deal, man.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Rod, get on the camel.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
First, single mothers don't date. They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
No, I don't know.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
The kid is amazing.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the pooty from a single mom.
I didn't shoplift the pooty.  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
You never had The Talk, did you?
No.
Well, this was another way to go.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
No.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
No, you're --
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Not everyone has what you have.
You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
I'm sorry I asked.
Damn right.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really friends?
Why not --
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our friends hats on --
I think so.
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Fine.
Beautiful.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Go.  Flee.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
I have to ask.
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
How about it?
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
so our first date; she told me about her favorite place in the world; the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- Hurry up
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
But wait...
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, Well
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
How can I make your life better?
Not a chance.
I'll go back to them.
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
Marcee --
Don't be silly.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
Pleasure.
You okay?
I'm fine.  What's up?
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Pardon me?
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
You...
You did this to yourself.  You said fewer clients.  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
... dick?
Dick.
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
You'll lose.
You wanted smaller.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Jerry --
-- and I'll get 'em.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
One-two-three, swing.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
They do, my brother.
Hi.
Hi Ray.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
You said fuck.
Yeah I know.  I did.
I won't tell.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
I don't see any.
Funny.
What's going on, Jerry?
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
I'm scared.  What is it?
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
I hear you've got visitors.
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You're gonna help us take him.
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
But she doesn't want to date.
Exactly my point
You lying son of a bitch...
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Up there.
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
My assistants, I presume.
You look like brothers.
Have you worked here long?
What was the matter with it?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
I don't know what you could have read.
Just what you've published.
in magazines Nobody reads.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Did you?
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
in What sense?
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
Success or nothing?
No -- not even success.  My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.  Not for other people, it's for me.
You work in the cemetery.
The Castle cemetery.
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
oh; yes; determination runs in the family.
There is one thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
In a manner of speaking.
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
An empty tomb?
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
you appreciate my writing.
Yes.
Will you do me a favor then?
Another one?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
A true friend would do it.
Not necessarily.  A wife would.
I gave it to him yesterday.
No, I left it in his office.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
Yes.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
You're just doing your job.
You're detestable.
You wanted to see me, sir.
Sit down, Kafka.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
I usually take lunch by the River.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
No, sir.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
Well, I --
-- Eduard --
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
In a small way.
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
I do.
Was there something else?
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
The Orlac claim.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
I know.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
One of you must be mistaken.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
Hello again.
I've never seen you here before.
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
Yes.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
No.
I suspected that he -- well.
What?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
How long were you and Eduard --
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the hands of the police.
What could he have done to warrant that?
Tonight?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
... All right.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
What of it?
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
He was murdered.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Yes -- which is why quiet
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
They're not obliged to tell.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  He could've killed Eduard.
You don't believe that.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
He's jealous, yes, but that jealous?  He's too cautious.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I've heard of it happening.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Usually.
Or what if there really was an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
Gabriela ...?
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
I -- I found your jailer.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
No -- not this time.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Accident And Compensation Association.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Eight -- and seven months.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
I don't know.
Was he depressed?
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
No, I suppose not.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
We know that.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
What makes you think so?
... Just a perception.
Probably not.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
I'll bear that in mind.
should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one shut -- not at all.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
Do you?
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
You mean you've actually begun some?
What's the matter with you?
you should meet my father.
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
It's a farce.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young clerk could find himself in such a fix.
Then why haven't I been --
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of this group.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to yourselves!
... A piece of paper ...
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
Accident and Compensation -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
Raban -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
It usually is.
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
I'm overworked as it is.  Raban did you say?
Yes.  Isn't it there?
Wait a minute.  Raban?  Where have I heard that name?
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
What's the matter?
Why would we keep files on dead employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
It's gone out so quickly?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
you mean my chief has it.
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
Orlac is an account?
It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
I could always apply there.
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle is one of the Directors of this firm.
You're done.  End of story.
You got a name, cop?
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, I noticed...
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
You killed him.
He just appeared.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
Yeah?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I'll think about it.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Oh, but you have, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
Go ahead.
It happens when I land.
He's not gonna hurt me.
No.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you were on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
--Who is he?
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
Mr. Cyr!
C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
And what would he do come winter?
Around here.  Yeah.
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
We'd only just met.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Keystone what?
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
We are here on official business.
Cocktail?
No!!  What's with digging the holes?
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
Could she stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
No!!  Out!
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
And you like me.
What the hell are you doing?!!
What are you doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
A spring trap!
I keep telling you, they can come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
I coulda shot you, you--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it is a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they do charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
They don't really attack underwater and--
That Walt guy got hit underwater--
No crocodile has ever--
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Is this a trick?
What I'm saying is if it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Was he a good man?
Yup.
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Bite my bishop.
What's that?
It came from across the lake.
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
That sounds good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
Raincheck.
Then do it!!
You probably do want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
So profound and fat.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
No!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
I don't know!
At school they'd always say go first.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
He never said go.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Hey!!
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Forget it.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
No way.
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
We both know what they'll do.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
That's actually the easy part.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
Right.
The more he thrashes, the better.
You ready on shore?
We're ready.
I got something on the screen.
You do?
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  Everybody up on the trucks.
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling go which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
Where is he?
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
You take care.
You talk to Bickerman?
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
Just those two.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since he's the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
That hurt my feelings.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
I never had sex with you!
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
Hector.
None of us actually saw anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
What's going on?
Such the flirt.
You should take a flax pole.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
I'm just saying last resort.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
What?  Oh as if I'm interested.
As if.  Will you miss me?
He was an Indo-pacific.
Scales were oval.  It was an Asian crocodile.
Jack!
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
You think I'm that nuts?
Nothing's real.
Excuse me?
Nothing's real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
With crocodiles... everything's even.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Didn't even sound good?
No.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
What?
Could we have intercourse?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
They could try to tranq him on land.
They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
And how would we neutralize him?
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
I'm okay.
Guess I finally got bit.
He's gonna live?
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Kelly Scott.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Yes, it did seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it worked, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a small point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by him, but you seemed quick to join in.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
How big do the bears get?
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in water.  On land maybe.  But...
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
Hank says he's sure.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never believed it.
Why are you here?  Really.
How would you know, what--
And even if they did, I doubt he or she would have problems with tents.
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
I'm not making it up.
Well.  You don't have to stay out here, why don't--
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
Oh my God.
If this is who I think it is.  It is.
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
In Maine?
There have been Northern sightings. But not this North.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Something's in that water.
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
Baby crocs?
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
I'd be able to see something.
What are you doing?
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I beg your pardon?
Whatever's out there did flip over a canoe--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
You flew up here because your boss--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
Okay.  We're up at six.
'Night.
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
Good.  See ya soon.
Good luck.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
Are you okay?
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I didn't say it like that.
You did, you--
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Just forget it.
But why Maine and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Like little children.  You okay?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Let's get away from the shore.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Ow.  Shit.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
No thanks.
Thank you.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
Maybe.  I've always read about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace while something is actually... y'know... happening.
Night.
Well.  Goodnight.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
We could not say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
I heard something.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
Thing we can lift it?
I'm not mushing it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
I'm not mushing it.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
That is it!!
Calm down.
You calm down!
Calm down.
Look.
Alright, Jack!
No!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
Okay.
We might as well pack.
Good idea.
Well...
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
He has been going after everything. It could work.  But this is not a happy cow.
He looks like a giant tea bag.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He's floating.  Take it home.
Hector.
He's mooing.
You wouldn't?
Watch out!!
Hector!!
Take him.
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
Well...
You wanna ride in my truck?
No, I actually want to stay for a little while.
If I'm ever in New York...
Yeah.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and...
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
It was... something meeting you.
Different worlds, Jack.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
No.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
You think?
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
Good thinking.
We set?
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
I'm ready when you are.
Let's go.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
I'll call the coroner.
What's that?
Are they feeding?
Doesn't look like it.
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
You said nobody came in here!
Obviously I was wrong!
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
So does he.
Now I'm gonna puke.
Even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
Other than to eat us?
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
If you get a safe shot...
I'll take it!
Hector.  Do not move.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
Thanks for your help.
He just came up screaming.
Did he say anything?
And you didn't see anything?
There?  That's the morgue.
Yes.
Is the dead guy in there?
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
Well.  At wakes.
This is a little different.
I can look at dead things.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Yes.
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
Not yet.
We?
What?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
I got nothing against--
Ever even been in one?
What is that?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
You're sort of a rude person.
It's just that--
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
Was he swallowed?
Sheriff.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
Gee.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Yes, camp, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard tents, will there be toilets?
What the hell?
What?
I thought I saw...
It looks like a branch.
You threw it at me!!
I just let go of it.
With what?
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker.
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
I'm sorry.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
I asked you to be nice to him.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
What?  I don't even know the guy.
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
What is this?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
That was a bust.
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Hank?
Yes.
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
Hank!
He said he knew Karate!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
What is she doing now?  Mother of God.
What?
Look ten feet into the water.
If he gets close, you go up, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
She's worried about the cow now.
That it's about to go wrong.
Did you get him?
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Should I?
I guess.
Kevin, hey.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
Absolutely.
Me too.
That's not what you came to say.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, us...
I was working for you when us started, what's--
The somebody else part?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Else.
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, you... you're y'know...
A jerk.
Oh...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Yes, well...  famished.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth?
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I want you to go there.
Sorry?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
This is what we do?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Are you on drugs?
Kelly--
Part of our research--
I'm not even a field person.
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
I never do field work and even if I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Kelly--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Well you shouldn't have.  How did you even know where I was.
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
You?
You?
You and Kevin.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
No.
Myra.
I really... I should get back.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Daddy, I --
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since Gloria Steinem over there isn't going --
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
No way to start a partnership.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Yeah.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn trim hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Now, where we goin', convict?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night.
You have a good time?
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
No.  Caspiar.
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
People love... comedians.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
Sitcom...?
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
George, I hate sitcoms.
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  Latka
No?  No to which part??
No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
You have to do it.
I refuse.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Those are my terms.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Andy?
Hi George!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
That's alright.  Where...?
Andy!
What's up?
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. Hey look
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
How long would they let me sleep?
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
Well?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
There'll be other shots.
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: Look
But wasn't it funny?
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
They're having a laugh...
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  Here I come to save the day!?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
We were just trying to push the envelope --
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
What was that all about?
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
So how can I help you...?
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
My hair is coming out.
Yeah...
Really?
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
What do you want?  Take my wife
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
B-but I have them.
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
But it's only for thirty seconds!
Twenty!
Deal.
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
What do you mean?
I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through On Golden Pond.
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Popcorn?
No thanks.
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through On Golden Pond.
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
I'm here, ain't I?
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
Yes.
Why Memphis?
And all this will be for real?
If you want...
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Go away.
It's me.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Have you told your family?
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
How can you be so casual??!
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Okay.  You're probably right.
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
You're not listening to me --
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
And you're just poor white trash!
Hey Andy, good show.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
Each show is worse than the next.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
So?  What do they know?
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Give me the book.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
It's so dirty.
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
What is this, World War Two...?
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi...
It's working for Elvis.
Sir, do you have a problem?
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
I was very original!
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
And you say, Santa
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Yes, your Holiness?
Why??  I... I attend every year.
Philosophically?
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Are you sure?
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Can I help you with something?
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
That was a really hot house!
So your name's not Gorsky.
Don't believe everything you hear.
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual...
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
Why...?  Andy, why...?
I used to think you were original.
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
That's never been one of my problems.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
What are you talkin' about?
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
The bet's off.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, there's someone I think might be --
It's just a party. Daddy.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
There.
Must be billy's girl.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
Half a million.
Jesus.
Just tell me about the money.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
He's after your money.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Wear the belly before you go.
Just for a minute
We split 50-50?
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Who's dead?
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
I don't like him.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
I have no money!
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
I won't pay for nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Rita. Pass the wine.
Why you drinking so much?
Where you been?
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
Cosmo?
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Thank you, Rose.
You're welcome.
I'm going to bed now.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
His brother.
Have I been a good wife?
Yes.
I want you to stop seeing her.
Okay.
And go to confession.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Rose, pass the wine.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
No. You were there.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
I have my eyes open.
I don't know what you mean.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Where's Ma?
Bed.
You're not sleepy?
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Pop, I got news.
Here.  Ti amo.
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
Again?
Yeah.
You did this once it didn't work out.
The guy died.
What killed him?
He got hit by a bus.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
Johnny Cammareri.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
In a month.
I won't come.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
Maybe.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
He did?
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
Here.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
It's temporary.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You're married.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Alright. I didn't see you here.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
I brought you something.
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Why didn't he call himself?
He's in Palermo.
What's wrong can never be made right.
Let me come and talk to you.
Have you come from my brother?
Yes.
Why?
You are going to marry my brother?
Excuse me.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
Maybe I should come back another time.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancÃš saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
I'm making you a steak.
You don't have to help me.
I like it well done.
This is good. Uhh...
Loretta.
Where'd Johnny find you?
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
Yesterday.
Why?
Why what?
I don't know.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Seven years ago.
How many men since then?
Just Johnny.
Stupid yourself.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Why you talking to me?
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
She was right to leave me.
Yes.
You don't know nothing about it.
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I'm a wolf?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I'm telling you your life!
No!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
Because I have no Luck!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
A wolf without a foot!
Son of a bitch!
To the bed.
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
I was dead, too.
Your blood.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
Loretta.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
I've got you.
Get all of me. Take everything.
What about Johnny?
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
Where's the money?
What?
That light.
It's so bright.
I've never seen a moon like that.
Oh my God.
What?
What? What have we done?
This time I was trying to do everything right.
Don't just become excited.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
I'm marrying your brother!
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
She didn't like me.
You don't get along with anybody!
What did you do?
What did I do?
You ruined my life.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Oh no I didn't!
What?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
I can't do that!
Why not?
I'm in love with you!
Snap out of it!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
What are you talking about?
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Thank you.
Who painted that?
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Kinda gaudy.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
Thank you!
For what?
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
So. Where are we sitting?
They get some turnout for this stuff.
It's the best thing there is.
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
That was just so... awful!
Awful?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
Yeah.
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
No thanks.
I think that's it.
What do you want to do now?
I wanna go home.
It's really cold.
Yeah. It smells like snow.
What's the matter?
How can you ask me that?
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I know what I know.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
He didn't come!
I'm here!
You're late!
This is your place.
That's right.
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
Why?
I'm afraid of who I am.
I was.
And you're not now?
Why not?
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
Let me go home.
No.
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Ronny!
Is Johnny here?
He's coming.
You've gotta get outta here.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Ronny, please...
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
Loretta?
What!
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
I got things to do.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Right.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Yeah, I'll be in.
Hi.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
You? No.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
You don't want the fish.
No?
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Maybe you're right.
She was too young for him.
You never have dessert.
Never is a long time.
What's the matter?
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
Have Something.
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
What?
Will you marry me?
Bobo, take the cart away.
Are you proposing marriage to me?
Yes?
What do you mean?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
Yes, on the floor.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
Alright.
I like this ring.
What time is it?
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
How near is she to death?
Then let's set the date.
How about a month from today?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Alright. A month. In a month.
A month from today?
Yeah.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
Who is he?
He's my younger brother.
You have a brother?
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Sure.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
How was your plane ride?
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
Have you told her we're getting married?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
We should talk alone.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
I have no secrets from my family.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
WHAT?
If I marry you my mother will die.
I must ask for that back.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Where's the ring?
No.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
And who's gonna pay for that?
No.
Why not?
Pop don't like Johnny.
So we'll sell the house.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
No. He don't.
How's the mother?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Did he tell her?
Where you been?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What! How do you know?
A wife knows.
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
What the hell happened to you?
Your hair's different.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
Where's pop?
What? He's in Sicily!
He's with his dying mother!
It was a miracle.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Do you love him, Loretta?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Oh God, that's too bad.
Hi.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
What's the matter with him?
What about the moon?
Did you see it?
No.
Oh.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Hi, Loretta.
We just come from the bank.
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancÃš, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
I... a... slept with my fiancÃš's brother.
Moving in?
I came right from the airport.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
So.
Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
It's late.
Yes.
Maybe I should go?
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
My mother's recovered.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
That's incredible.
Yes.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
That's it! That's the reason!
I don't know.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Okay, I'll tell her.
Loretta...
Johnny...
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Good.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Of course I want to.
It was a miracle!
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Can I get another one of these?
Do you have a girlfriend?
What happened?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
She was just too young for you.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
None of your business.
Sorry. That was rude.
Will you join me for dinner?
Are you sure?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
What do you do?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
That woman was a student of yours?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Yes.
Don't shit where you eat.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Why do men chase women?
Nerves.
I think it's because they fear death.
What you don't know about women is a lot.
May I walk with you a ways?
Sure.
You knew that man?
Yes.
Temperature's dropping.
Yes.
I guess you can't invite me in?
No.
People home.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
I'm a little cold.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Good night.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
Sure.
Good night.
Marriage is happy news.
Rita. Rita.
What? What?
Look.
It's Cosmo's moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
I don't know.
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
You were a tiger last night.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
You got me.
You see that moon last night?
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancÃš's in Palermo.
I knew she had it.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Right, partner.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah.  Right.
How do you know she is a witch?
Bring her forward.
Did you dress her up like this?
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Does wood sink in water?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Yes!
...What?
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
Through ... We found them.
What do you mean?
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
Please!
I'm not interested.
And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
The Britons.
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
What?
I am your king!
You don't vote for kings.
Who are they?
Knights Who Say Ni ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
Oh!
Oh!
A what?
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
Of course.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What is that?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
What word?
What, is?
None shall pass.
None shall pass.
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
So be it!
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Come on then.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Course I have.
Look!
What!  Just a flesh wound.
Stop that.
I'll have your leg.
I'll do you for that.
You'll what ... ?
Come Here.
I'm invincible!
You're a looney.
The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Come, Patsy.
Hello.
Are you sure he's got one?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
My liege ... forgive me ...
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
My liege,  I am honored.
What is your name?
Bedevere, my Liege.
Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
OF course, my Liege ...
Who ... Who breaks out?
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say Ni!
No!  Not the Knights Who Say Ni!
Nu!
No.  Ni!  More like this. Ni!
Ni, ni, ni!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
Ni!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
Ni!
No.  No.  No!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
There!  Look!
What does it say?
What?
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
What?
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.  Now the rest of you stand |      well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              HECTOR |      Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              ROBIN |      Look out. | |  The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them.  The KNIGHTS retreat |  into the darkness of the cave. | |                              GAWAIN |           |      It's only a cartoon. | |                              ARTHUR |      Sh!
We shall attack at once.
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Who are they?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
I am an enchanter.
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Quite.
What?
A Grail?
Look, you're a busy man ...
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Follow!
Too late.
What?
There he is!
Where?
There.
Behind the rabbit?
... You silly sod.
What?
You got us all worked up.
Je...sus Christ!
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Who did we lose?
Old woman!
I'm thirty-seven.
What?
:Well - I can't just say:  Hey
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
Yes.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Yes, I see.
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Be quiet!
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Shut up!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Shut up!
Bloody peasant!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Come on, patsy.
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Good idea, O Lord!
Well?
The nose?
Why do you think she is a witch?
And therefore?
Where's the goddamn car?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You just drove by it.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Shit.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Are you writing a poem?
Do you still teach?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
People said she looked like me.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
How did you know my name?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
This is California, anything is possible.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
I don't think you're very polite.
THANK YOU.
I don't even know your name.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
What about giving the other guy a break.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
What do you remember about her.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
Suspended from school, my mother??
Pommeroy.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Do what?
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Visualize a spare?
Well you know what I mean.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
I figured you did.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
What boy likes you?
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
Of course.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
I already bought a ticket.
What??
I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
No nuns, got it.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
What does that mean?
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Hi Dad.
Hi honey.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Yeah.
Totally groovy huh?
Totally.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
I will. How's Shelly?
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Give my love to Shelly.
What happened to Shelly?
We have a baby?
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Can I see him?
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
How about a nice glass of milk?
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
No.
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
You're being narrow-minded.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maybe he's hungry.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
Thanks.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
What're you saying?
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
You mean, you knew about me?
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
I'd like to, thanks.
Does she?
I'm glad you're here.
You are?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
I told you it was a long story.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Special effects?
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
I'll try.
And she saved it.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Do you have any pictures if her?
She's beautiful.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
Well...
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
oh.
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
Come on in!
It's just a corpse.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
See you? He can smell you from there.
What's the matter?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
But I wanna write about her.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
Hello.
What can I do for you?
I guess you have.
This is really very nice of you.
O.K. Thank you very much.
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
I never met my mother.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Thanks
Give it back Nicholas!
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
There's water in your bathroom.
Don't wake up Vada.
I won't.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
You're so clever.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
You're over reacting!
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
MOM!
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
No THANKS!
He said it was a gift.
Yeah, RIGHT.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
Getting off please.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
WHAT??
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
What difference does it make?
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
I'd never do that.
Get married?
What, you think the guy should change his name?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
Why do you argue with everything I say?
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
You ratted on my mother??
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
Care for a smoke?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
You would.
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
May I use the phone please.
Boy, you're really into this.
He is one of the great poets.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
And I thought I was weird.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Does it work?
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Boyfriend?
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
DON'T, come on!!!
Woah, watch it!
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
...I dropped it.
In the tar??
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
Oh no?!?!?!
Leave me alone!!
You mean,  this ring?
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Never heard of her.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Here's Judy Garland!
My mother stood on this very spot.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Big deal.
What's he smoking?
What do you think?
This is a totally barbaric custom.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
It's not his fault!
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
Like what?
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Nick?
Yeah?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
An adventure?
Write me a poem?
No?
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
What's that?
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.
Wow!
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
You're a good man Nicholas.
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
Was Rose.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
Rose this not the place to be having this...
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
They're great.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
She lives here too?
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
But...are you engaged or something?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed?
Committed.
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Yes, it does.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Lock the door.
Bye.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
A secret, I like that.
This is it I guess.
You want me to come with?
I should do this myself.
Okay.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
He was caressing.
Phil for God sake.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Oh...what's that?
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
Hi!
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
There's plenty of fruit.
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
I think this place is just fine.
You know how I feel about you.
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Is that a yes?
You're Nick's mother?
I'm just tired.
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Not exactly.
Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
She'll be all right baby.
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
Bye Niece, Vada.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Excuse me?
I was commenting on your hair.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
...so I guess I'll always...teach...you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
I'll be here.
Good morning.
Well maybe for you.
Something wrong?
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
You couldn't?
Sort of?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Oh, sure okay.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
You're telling me.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Why not now?
What do you mean?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
You leave your father to me.
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
I know, look at his little hands.
You have no idea.
Let me hold him.
O.K.
Really?
He's a great poet.
Do you know him?
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
Arthur!!
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Wanna play?
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
You're such a baby.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Danny?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
The boss is watching us...
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Ex...ex, ex...
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Yes.
Can't you see it?
It's there.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
It's still available I hope?
I think it's still available.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
Excuse me, what about the job?
Pardon?
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
Uh huh?
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
Yeah.
You don't like it?
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
What do you mean??
Oh that, she just likes to play.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Harry, I really think she.....
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I'm sure she will.
Hi.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I wrote that.
No kidding?
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
It's no big deal.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Okay.
Does it make it easier to win?
No. Just, more activity.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
What's that?
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Kinda like men.
Oh, how do you mean?
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
I had a good time tonight.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
Okay, sure.
Home sweet home.
It's nice.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
Are you mad at me?
No, why?
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
What happened to her?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Did she ever see Vada?
Dance with me?
Here?
This is where we are.
Is there enough room?
I haven't danced in.....
In ages, I know, me neither.
Rock?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
What are you wearing?
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Do you want to?
Yes.
I ahh, better go.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight Shelly.
Goodnight.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Okay.
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
I'll second that.
Shelly?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Well, you were pretty great!
Is it really your camper?
Can we see it from the back yard?
You can get the general idea...
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Pointing upwards Look...
Did you ahh, love him?
Perfect.
I don't know which ball's mine.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Ahem.
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Hand me the canula.
Dad?
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle.....
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Of course not.
Then who's it for?
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Any more soda left?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Dad?
I love this guy!
What?
The money?
Ahh, maybe next summer.
Goodnight Vada.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
You never cared before.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Why?
She likes to play bingo.
Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Sorry.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
Are they ready yet?
No, sweetie, not yet.
Soon honey, soon.
When??
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
Yes..
I like the freak show.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
Hi Vada.
Hi.
Feeding my fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
No sweetheart, you can't.
Why not?
He was allergic to bees.
There were just too many of 'em.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Get away, get away!!
Did I kill my mother?
What??
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
No, no.
I found this.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
In the garage.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
What was my mama like?
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Do you miss her?
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
I'm very nervous.
Oh come on.
Are you sure about all this?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Sure.
Bye.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
This is one big house for one single person.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
How much does it cost?
What do you get for that?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
I paid the money.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
I wrote a poem too.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
Who's that?
No....
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Does he love her?
Do you like her?
Why?
Is that your camper?
That's really cool.
She's shy.
Oh.
I am.
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
He's allergic to everything.
Chocolate?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
He won't give it to me.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Come on sweetie.
Hi.
Can we look around in your camper?
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Big Ringo fan.
I would.
Thomas?
Did you read ALL these books?
Uh huh.
What are they about?
Mostly love, and romance.
No, I'm divorced.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Can I use your bathroom first?
Sure.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Okay.
Are you going out somewhere?
No.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
A girl's always gotta look her best.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Come here, sit down.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Uh huh, why?
See food!
I like my name.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Are you here to take Shelly back?
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
I won, I won!!!
Oh great!!
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
Daddy??!?!?!
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Where's Daddy?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I don't want, I don't need your help....
How old are you?
I'm eleven and a half.
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
I think it should be outlawed.
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
I will I promise.
Thomas J?
I'm allergic to it.
To chocolate?
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Uh huh.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
They're just fun to read.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
What are you saving for?
Oh great!
I knew he wouldn't come.
I can't, I have to go home.
Hey look at this, no feet!
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
At what?
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Hi Mr. Bixler!
No, I'm going home.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
It doesn't work, it always stays black.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Oh no!  UUH.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It'll bleed.
If I do it, can we go?
Uh huh.
Okay, OW!
Your lip bleeding?
No.
What's wrong with your eyes?
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Where's your bike?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Hey look at this!
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
No, I don't wanna.
Hmmmm, interesting.
What?
You have no personality.
Never mind.
Is that your Dad?
Yes.
Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What do you think it's like?
What?
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
Here.
Sorry.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Pacifist!
Bed wetter!
I stopped that!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Duck!
Can we go yet?
Go???
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
What?
THIS!!
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
Woah!!
What?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
So?
Stand back.
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
Got it!
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
Run faster they're after us!!
Hurry!!!
Jump in the water!!
Do it!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Come on, let's go.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Bye Ma.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Really?
Get up!?
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
Why are you running away?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
So now you'll have a mother.
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
He likes her better than me.
Then go home, baby.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Okay, seeya.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
I dunno..
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Well when you get older, you just have to.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
It is not.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Not true.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Uh huh.
No.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
But, I don't know how.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Like this?
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Close your eyes.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Just do it.
Okay, okay.
Okay on the count of three.
Say something it's too quiet.
Umm, Ummmmm
Just, hurry.
You better not either.
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay.
Seeya tomorrow.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
What?
Would you think of me?
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
I should look different.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
He says, Swear.  When we're both 28
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
He can't do that to me!
We'll never be the same.
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
You flew all the way h...
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
I was devastated.
Because I realized.  When I see him say I do
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
... and having done the right thing will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
Sure.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
I wish.
Try less appropriate.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
I can't even say it.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
It's too late to start over.
Major.  Dish.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Needing.
And what will he do?
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
I did what I came to do.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
You need a few dollars.
Excuse me?
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
But I can't be dry.
Can you watch the road?
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
Which was the disqualifying factor?
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
What else did he tell you...
... you hate weddings, you never go.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
He said that, too.
Don't you have to be somewh...
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
How about...
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
And loving him means loving all of this.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Let me rephrase that...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
... except one.
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
No.
And the answer was so simple.
You win.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
I've missed a step.
Jesus, we're trapped!
Ju...
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
I mean, he loves his job.
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
But he always says...
... whatever is manly and independent.
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Gold nose hair clippers.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Hello.
So... one almost has to...
Exactly.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
He'll see right through it.
Only.  If he wants to.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
He won't get mad, huh?
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
I just don't want to freak him out.
Uh, Kimmy...?
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for Do you take this man?, that's considered poor form.
... that this is all my fault?
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I love him.
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
I never want to go through this again.
That's entirely understandable.
... unless he has a hump.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
I saw the show.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
You are so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
Is anybody watching?
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
I think he's been fired.
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Nobody has.  So far.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
I've been calling for days!
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, somet...
I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
Well, sure.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
You've met her parents.
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
... Thomas, yeh.
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Please come, please.
W...
I can't wait for you to meet her!
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
What's the sec...
Mirrors.
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
Such as.
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
What's next?
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Endearingly absent-minded.
My very point.  Here's another one...
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Quite the little eccentric.
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Waiter! Check, please!
She finds him personable.
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Firenze.
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Till the gas ran out.
Should I whistle down a cab?
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
What, leaving school...
... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
You're not eating.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
Boy, those were the days.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
Never can tell.
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
Michael!!
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's needs
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Like I said, dazzling.
You keep saying that.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
You miss her, huh?
No.  I've got you.
Don't you throw up on boat?
If you like.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
Have you.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
It's more than that.
You've been the man in mine.
Except for that.
Me either.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
Dance card filled?
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
Where did we first hear th...
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
Takes me back.
Well.
No accents today.
Will she like it?
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
I'm up against a deadline.
That's my point!!
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
This thing means that much to y...
It means a lot.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
... maybe it's congratulations.
Michael? What ha...
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl.
What happened?
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
A bad combination.
Michael...
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
This is her family and her fault.
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
I asked you...
She admits it's her fault.
Does that make it right...
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Thank God you were here.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it happens.
... your one chance for true happiness?
... yeah, that.
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
The Big Hurt, huh?
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
What's up?
Shhh.
Jules, what's wrong...
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
Uh.  I saw that moving...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
ARE YOU CRAZY?
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
Lower.
Lower.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
This is where I proposed.
I never forgot that.
Almost three.
That is so romantic.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
That's little egotistical.
If you find her...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
The most important thing. Is being together.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
It's not just a gag, huh?
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
Like family, huh?
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
To him.
And to m...
... and you knew about this.
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.
Well, if that's the way you f...
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says Mikey-poo? Or do I have to change my name to Binky?
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
MICHAEL!!
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
You stay with me...
No way...
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
What?
Well, do you?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in  head of cattle, whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like I could eat a horse.
Nice.
How long will they watch us for?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Why do they listen to Guy?
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Yeah. Let's do that.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Oh I know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Thanks.
Sure. No problem.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Petty good.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
College?
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection
What is with this school and prom?
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
What's that?
That's the old drive-in. They call it The Court. Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Yes, it's lame.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Exactly.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
Remember, that poet that we liked Ã» the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Right. 7:30.
I'm late for lab.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Oh. I forgot.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Oh, man! Who told?
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
YOU DID.
YOU KNIT?
Leave.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
You're Pam?
If you say so.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Right. Right.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
What about the Roaring TwentiesÃ  or The 80's?
Guess who I did it with last night...
Who told!
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him.
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
You stood for like a month.
Forget it.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Anita!
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexyÃ¹  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
My own undercover feature - Written by Josie Geller.
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
You don't think I can do it.
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Jos, that's not what we're --
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Senorita Josie.
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Okay. That's bad.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Now this is cute.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Bridgework?
Very romantic.
How about this?
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
Cuuuute!
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
Hi!
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Wow. It's packed.
George! What are you doing here?
What is this?
Wings?
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Transitioned?
Betty.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From As You Like It?  Shakespeare?
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. Hopefully is an adverb. It means with hope. You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
How many times have I fired her?
Five-- Six--
Eh.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
You've done five of my ideas.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Oh. Right.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call The Court. Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, Yeah
Kristen got a quote?
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Uhh, no.
Have you been to any parties?
Well, how would you define to parties? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
Do you even know these kids?
They hid my car--
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
OUT!
Gus?
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
What if I say no?
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
That's your story!
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
He's my teacher!
And that's the best part.  Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close? We're gonna blow the lid off it!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Oh my god.
Rob's?
Hey. There.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
You said that already.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
You can't just borrow my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
Wow. This must be big.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
What!?
Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -
Don't you remember what they called you?
Josie Grossie.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Are mom and dad here?
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Good.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
I can't do this.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Rob. Please focus.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Is that true?
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Yes, desperately.
That's the spirit!
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
No. Josie, this is real.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
You're twenty-three years old!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
And a gymnast!
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Duh. Tom Cruise. Risky Business.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Really?
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
wasn't even thinking about-
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
I-
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Sorry. Forgetful.
Dorothy Parker--
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  Art is a form of catharsis
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Oh I don't think so.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Thank you.
So what are you thinking for college?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon? How for her it was like a Concord grape. That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
This seat taken?
Thank you.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
You remember that story?
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
Yoooooow.
Don't look down!
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
I don't have to say that.
Boys.
I know.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Why do you do that?
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
I'm thinking when I'm home.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your can do attitude.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
To put us back together again when we fall.
Our penguin, right?
Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, actually I do.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Oh--yikes!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Thanks. So do you.
Well, are you here with anybody?
No, I'm alone.
It's weird because prom is actually from the word promenade. And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
Yeah, I have.
Surprise! you were doing a story on me?!
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
But now you don't have to--
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Please. Please don't walk away.
I just can't look at you the same way.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
I finally found my story.
Why?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Yeah. Definitely.
Wow - I-
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a hot rod.  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Hi.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
I'm a vegetarian.
Lovely to meet you.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
That was such a great evening.
I'm delighted.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
No!
Night, night, Honey.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I'm not listening.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
I'm an actress.
Well, they can be.
Films mainly.
Fifteen million dollars.
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Fine.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Really?
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Sorry about that...
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
Oh Jesus.
Here, let me help.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
No thanks.
Orange juice -- probably not.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Really, no.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
No.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Thank you.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
I forgot my bag.
Here we go.
Thanks.  Well...
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Bye.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Hi.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Oh -- Okay.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Hi.
Hello.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
And what happens next in the dream?
Yes.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Okay -- fine.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
If that's all right.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
Okay.
Floppy, huh?
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
Too complicated.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
I thought you were leaving.
I was.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Let's go in.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
You abide by rules like that?
Whoopsidaisies.
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said whoopsidaisies for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Exactly.  Here we go again.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
Step aside.
She left me.
Why?
She saw through me.
I'm sorry.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
No, you were brilliant
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
I don't know either.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
You've got to go.
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
Hi.  Can I come in?
Come in.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
This is the place.
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
A bath would be great.
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I have thought about you.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Well done you.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Eleven.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Cartwright.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
My son's name is Johnny?
Yup.
Well, get a message through to him too.
What do you think?
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
You like Chagall?
With a goat playing a violin.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Yes.  Always have had.
No.  What's that?
Big feet -- large shoes.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Both.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Right.
Oh please sod off.
Okay.
No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
You and every person in this country.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Well...
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Oh.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Damn, I forgot the jam.
What?
Don't ask.
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
Undressed like this, yes.
How are you doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
That's not true.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
That's spectacularly unfair.
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
Excuse me?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Okay.
Hi.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Well... how have you been?
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
I thought I'd give it to you.
Thank you.  Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
What's the thing?
You were saying...
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Sorry about that.
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
The truth is...
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the Don't Disturb sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
So you took the rest of the night off...
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
And what would you say...
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Nice surprise.
I haven't decided.
Yes.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Is that right?
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
He's bringing a girl?
Does the girl have a name?
Christ, what is going on in there?
And this is William.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Bella -- this is Anna.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Yes, I think that one may be.
Bernie.
What?
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Hello, Bernie.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Where's Bella?
Is this your first film?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Da Vinci?
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Me?
Well, yes.  Groovy.
I was called and I came.  What's up?
You daft prick!
What happened?
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
What do you think?  Good move?
Ahm... room service.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
I'll see what I can do.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Right.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
Ahm... Bernie.
I agree.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
This is Henry James film?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Any bit in particular?
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
So it could have been neither of them?
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Right -- want another one?
Martin -- your customer.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Max.  This is Anna.
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
So I get the brownie?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
No -- did you?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Buggered?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Really?
That's not fair.
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Is it someone we know?
Any more announcements?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
Oh God no.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
Hello.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
How about Miss Flintstone?
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
No, no.  She doesn't.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
What are the choices?
Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Point taken.
Cool, huh?
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Good luck.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Hey.
Hi...
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Two?  That's it?
You want me to write down all your messages?
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Right.  No one else?
Absolutely not.
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
Try 'Flintstone.'
What?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
No, 'fraid not.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Sort of.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Oh my God...  Hello.
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
Spike.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Maybe.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Spike!
No -- you're right.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
I wouldn't go outside.
Why not?
Just take my work for it.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Was it you?
Right.
What's going on?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Which floor?
Are you sure you...?
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Excuse me.
Bad news.
The one down your trousers.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Yeah. Guess not.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Of course not.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Excuse me?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
Because.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
No.
No.
--separate, in the evening..."
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
Let's find a telephone.
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
What?
What is it?
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about communication.  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Exactly.
Who's dying?
What great aunt?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
No.
There is one other thing you should know about me.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
What's mezzaluna?
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
Okaaaaayyyy.
No.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
But, Faith--
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
What?...
You...
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Congratulations.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Amazing.
Non.  Please.
Hm.
Hello?  Is anybody there?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
Damon Bradley...
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
That's not the point.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
That was before I found out what it was.
How could you do this to me?
I'm in love with you.
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
You're limping.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
NO.
You are leaving, aren't you?
Why can't you just tell me?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
Yes.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
He's safe.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
What?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
So?
So it wasn't real.
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Because I don't have the right name?!
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Who says I don't love him?...
Why not?
Because.  I know where he is.
Where's Positano?
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.
Why?
Because-- I want you to be happy.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Mickey Spillane?
Or Hustler.
He's out by the pool right now.
Right now?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
Hi, Peter.
Hi.
So.  You found him.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Oh.  That's nice.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
You too.
Hey--
Nice dress.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
What?...
What are you doing here?
We were hungry.
You were saying...
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
I don't know if that's such a--
Why are you doing this?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
How about music?  You like classical?
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
You okay?
Yeah.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
I'm sorry.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
No.  Course not.
Hi.
I know the feeling.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
You aren't?
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Well.  Congratulations.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Yes.  I am.
In that case... no...
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
Is something the matter?
GET OUT!!
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
There's no such thing.
What?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
I can't believe you did that!
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
What would you call it?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Very funny.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Really?...
Yes.
Yeah, I see her.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
There is no us.
I was hoping for the real thing.
I brought you that, too.
You're Damon Bradley?
Uh huh.
Hello.
Beautiful place...
Sure is.
Been here long?
Just since yesterday.
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Tonight?
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Sure.
You would?  Really?
I'll look forward to it.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Yes?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Sure.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Really?
Really...
Well, to-- new friends.
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
What looks good?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Faith, this is my mother.
Oh, hello.
Mommy, this is Faith.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
So, what are we waiting for?
What?
Let's face it.  You want me.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
I don't believe in statistics.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
No.  He smokes.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
How about that guy at the bank?
Scientologist.
Oh.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
I don't have an Amana freezer.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
Is everything okay?
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
But somebody wrote those songs.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
No.
Is he married?
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.
Thrills?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
Why don't you ask him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Yes you did.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
I know...  It was.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
I know.  You're right.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Kate, is something the matter?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
I think he's having an affair.
Have you seen him with someone?
No...  I can just tell.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
It's a miracle.
It's a coincidence.
The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
But it's July.
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
You don't have a passport.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
My God, you have...
Thank you so much.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Live happily ever after.
Maybe.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
You're coming with me?
You okay?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
Gritty?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
What?
Of the Rich and Famous.  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Are you sure?
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
We lost him?...
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
He fell out.
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
I just got a dial tone--
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
So?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Ah ha!...
What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
Oh.  Right.
We're saved!
What is it?
A phone message.  Only--
Only, it's in Italian...
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
I'm hungry.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Nothing.
You expecting somebody you know?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
Sorry.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
You think he misses me at all?
'Course he does.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
That was a long time ago.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
Larry bought himself cologne?
Polo.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
Her brother.
Right.  My brother.
What did you say to her?
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
What's she saying?
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Sure you did.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
He's heeeeeerrre...
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Is he looking at us?
Nope.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
Faith--
What?
Good luck.
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
And then what, Faith?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
That was really sweet...
I meant about my idea.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Like a detective.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Men have ways.
Hi-iii...
Hi.  Where've you been?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Packing.
Why?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
A little bad luck?
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
I know, but...
...and a fortune teller.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
What about Peter?...
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
What?
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
You sure you'll be okay?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
I'll be back before you leave.
Amazing...
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Joan Collins stayed here.
Is Damon Bradley here?
Whatareyoudoing?!
What if he doesn't like me?
My God... you're right.
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says nuculear and irregardless.
No one's perfect, Kate.
Maybe I can change him.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
He's a jerk.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Yup.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
When you could've found one in America.
So...
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Kate is that you?
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
Oh.
And Larry?...
What about Larry?
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Larry, did you rent a car?
Kate.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
A porco?
Oh.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
But I do want to.
Giovanni.
That's exactly what you are.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
You miss me?...
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
No, why?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
No.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
You said it differently then.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
What?  You know him?
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Went to high school with him. But...
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
He missed me.
Yeah--
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She what?!
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She didn't give me a chance.
I have to talk to her.
She's not here.
Where is she?
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
Good strategy.
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Mania.
Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
Thanks.
Sorry...
Notice something funny about that bus?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
And the one driving the other car?
What're you talking about?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Glenn Michaels.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
Yes, it is.
Who is it?
Lie face down on the floor.
Yes.
Yes.
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
No, thanks.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Did you know that when you married him?
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, Okay.  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Really.  Hm.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Till they got busted.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Ask him his name.
Who are you?
You're good.
Thank you.
Yes.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
His assistant.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Go away, or I'll call the police.
It's Richard Ripley.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Why don't we talk about it later?
Where in the hell are we?
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
Do we need him?
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
You're too late, Jack.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
You're right.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Oh, man.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
What?!
You better come see this.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Jack?
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Shit.
Nice disguise.
I'm a tourist.
You at least bring the gun?
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Uh-huh...
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Now you're talkin'.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
Love is funny.
Whatta you think?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Or two.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Outside of that.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
How long were you with the girl?
Forty-five minutes.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- alone.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and done it.  Do you?
What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
You might not have a choice.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
I saw Karen Sisco.
And she saw you?
Yes, she did.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
You find out?
Yeah, I did.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
I don't know.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
Whatta you wanna do?
You know they gonna set us up.
I get that feeling, yeah.
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
Half for doing what?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
And who watches your back?
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
You ever wear one of these?
They found the safe.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
They look like plain old rocks.
They sure do.
Come on.
Shit.
What?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
At least.
We made it, didn't we?
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone.
Hello, Daniel.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
You talked to him?
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
And what happened to Carl?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
I have to qualify, is that it?
You have to know what you're talking about.
You'll have to ask him.
Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
Shut up.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Daniel.  Listen --
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
They're in 7D.
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Call and tell you.
And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
Leave it where it is.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
What do you want to bet?
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
You don't, huh?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Ironic, isn't it?
How are you, Raymond?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Quite a mess.
Who?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
No, I didn't know that.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Who was the friend?
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
Hello?
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
There a problem, Foley?
Yeah.
How much for your company at chow?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I bet.  How much?
Another C.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Low class of people there, Snoop.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Glenn didn't tell you?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Let's go outside and talk.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Who's sitting here?
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
We're leaving.
The fuck you talking about?
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
I thought everything.
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
I wasn't asking permission.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
So you've done this before, huh?
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
Hey.  You learn from doing.
You know how to use one a these?
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Good luck, Richard.
Someone down here?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Nervous?
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
You're right.  So why take a chance--
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
You comfy?
If I could have a little more room.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
Where's your gun, your pistol?
In my bag, in the car.
Boy, it stunk in there.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
So, what's your name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
How many was that?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
I thought so, too.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
You don't seem all that scared.
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Uh-huh.
We still talk, though.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Is that right?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
I'm missing something.
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Network.  Yeah, she was good.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
Bleeding on a country road.
It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.
Nothing.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You'd probably tell me.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
You have to be kidding.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, Three Days of the Condor.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
Really.
I mean, romantically.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Get your hands up and turn around. Now.
Shit...
You know who this is?
Yes.
How'd you get this number?
Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.
That's my dad.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
You won't do that.
Why not?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Unless you wanna tell me.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
Whatta you mean we'll make it an island?
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
I can go to the bar.
Don't leave me.
Those guys bother you?
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
You like bourbon?
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
Is that how you think of yourself?
What, as a sales rep?
A girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
You did?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
How far do we go with this?
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Well, does it make sense to you?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, What if I had stopped and said something?  It might happen only a few times in your life.
Or once.
Oh, God...
I called your room from downstairs.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
It would be worth the risk.
You like taking risks.
So do you.
You really wear that suit.
That's not what you were about to say.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
She did, huh.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
He killed a police officer.
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
You believe that?
Why not?
What were you gonna do with me?
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
You waved to me in the elevator.
Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
You know I saw you on the street.
Where?
Outside Adele's.
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Why are you mad?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
What about my motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
I don't know.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
You getting serious on me now?
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You know.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
You think I'd shoot you?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
You just did, for Christ sake.
You know what I mean.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
So.  What's your point?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
You think he's lying?
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
Oh, nuthin'.
Take your sunglasses off.
I see better with them on.
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
Wait in the car.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
In the trunk?
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
I don't know...
Whose blood you got all over you?
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
I hear six.
Looks like tonight.
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Must be a real soft pillow.
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
Thanks for your help.
Any time.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
Really?
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do you believe Glenn?
Of course not.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You told him you keep 'em at your house.
It's a big house.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
It's a little late for me.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really want to change, it's never too late.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As security, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
The fish?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The next time I walk into a bank.
What's to think about?
You goin' right back to work?
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally relaxed...
Foley?  That you?
How are you, Richard?
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
Have they got Midge up there?
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
You gonna write me a check?
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
Five point two.
I were you, I'd get up and run.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
Hejira?  What kinda name is that?
Islamic.
What's it mean, No Hair?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The flight?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning time came, I left.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
That time?
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
The ninth?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Hejira.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
She did, huh.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Like what?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
Glenn?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
Do we have a gun in the car?
I remember you now.  Shit.
Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Wait.  Have you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Take the next exit.
Glenn, take the exit.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
You're not?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
What's going on, Glenn?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Really?
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
You crazy, come up here?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Someone?  Gimme a hint.
It's a guy you know.
You there?
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't you here?
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting you in on this, not all your friends.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Can I do what?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Right now, son.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without your ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
That was some shit, huh?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
Why would I do that?
Hi, Ray.
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
How's it going?
I can tell.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Flyweight.
You're not my type.
Just a minute.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
Moselle Miller?
I'm looking for Maurice.
That's not Maurice?
Thanks.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
No.
He said he stayed here last November.
What did you call it?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
The State Theater?
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
It's beautiful.
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
Thanks, Dad.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
He's still married though, huh?
Oh, he's moved out?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
You used to like it.
I really gotta go.
I'd like that.
You were talking in your sleep.
What'd I say?
Huh.
What are you thinking about?
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
No?
No, he looks a lot...
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
I see that.
Off a tip?
Hello?
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Not at all.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
Foley kidnapped me.
Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
Don't worry about it.
He waved to you?
You wave back?
I didn't have time.
I imagine you would've though.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What I want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
None I'd like to share.
You gonna go get him?
It's possible.  Why?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
Out for the evening?
When's he due back?
You here all by yourself?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
How do I look, mama?
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
That's how you score now?
Thank you...
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
What?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
I think it's Dunn & Bradstreet.  But then, I could be wrong...
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Well, I need that...
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Midge.
Foley's got it.
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
...the fuck is this...
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Do you believe in all of that?
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
GoodÃ¹bye, Grandma.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Do you have to wear that hat?
How do you like my hair?
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
Carol!
Peggy Sue!
Welcome to the singles scene.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Wouldn't we all.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
The only one?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
They're waiting. Come on.
I can't. It's all too much.
Go on. You can do it.
Where is it?
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
We're going to take you home.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
I'll call you Later.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
He does?
All right. What's the scoop?
On what?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
That loudÃ¹mouthed little bitch~
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
Aren't we a little old for that?
What's the matter?
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it. Page eightyÃ¹six.
Don't say that...
We're here on the sofa bed...
Charlie...
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
But you love me don't you?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
And nothing will ever change that.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
You got a Tab?
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
I'm not going.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Charlie! Am I dead?
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
How do you feel?
Pretty strange.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
You drive like a maniac!
I call this the staccato.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Oh yeah?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Refresh my memory.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Why wait?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Want me to drive you home later?
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Looking good out there.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Yeah. Like that.
Good.
Where did you get that sweater?
Great, isn't it?
Right. I promised my mother.
Is this slow enough for you?
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
He's trying.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Come on, let's dance.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You really love me, don't you?
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Charlie, let's make love.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Who?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
I'm sorry Charlie.
Save it.
What do you know about classical music?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Charlie. About last nights..
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Why?
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
I have to talk to you..
What are you doing here?
Let's go down to the basement.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did Book of Love Ã¹Ã¹ Chapter Four you break up
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
I just can't trust you anymore.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
But what has to be different?
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
What're you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Just take a look at it.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Does this mean you like me again?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
Forget it, it'll never work.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Right here. Now sit down.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
What?
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
Of course.
Oh, Charlie.
I love you.
Do I get to kiss her too?
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
I've got to go now.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Come back to me.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
Charlie? Was I dead?
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
What about Janet?
I'll just set it right here.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing I Wonder Why.
Oh, God, Dion.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
I'll never give up.
Then hold me.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Yes, sir. Trust is a twoÃ¹way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
What would that be, sir?
Of course.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Touchy, touchy!
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
I beg your pardon?
Have a nice day.
But I'm remembering the future.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
It was Beth's idea.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
You don't?
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author Ã¹ fat, violent, drunk...
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
This is great reefer.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
What are you shooting for?
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellÃ¹O for me, Mom.'
Don't you get along with your parents?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
I'd love to.
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
For everyone.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I hate chickens.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
You think so?
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
What a treat.
Ssh. He's great.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
I thought I knew everything about him.
Can we split now?
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
What?
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
That would be impossible.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
I think I'm way ahead of them.
At my age? Don't be silly.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Hi, Dad.
Open it.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
Quiet today?
The hat business is in trouble.
Yes.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
He'll win.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh no!
Oh, you're both so naive.
Mom!
I have a note.
I'm excused.
Mom!
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
I'm home now.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Oh. I forgot.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Sort of.
The house payments.
Who was that man?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
What do you mean?
For what?
I don't feel very festive.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Way to go, Mom!
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellÃ¹O.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
I'm just happy to see you.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Don't eat the red ones.
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips.
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
You have an incredible memory.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
But accidents can happen.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a fourÃ¹eyed worm.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
What was?
You're a sweet man, Richard.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
It really wasn't that difficult.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourÃ¹thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
What a great kite.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Sort of.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Okay. I promise.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
I don't know.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
There's one way to find out.
What're you doing?
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
Richard, take it easy.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Give me some credit, will you?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Wbat're you talking about?
You're taking advantage of a minor.
When do we start?
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Come on. You can't be serious.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifeÃ¹styles.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
What are you talking about?
High tech. I like the sound of that.
Hi, Richard.
What are you doing?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Like what?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
What will they be made of?
Silicon is from sand.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
What's the matter?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
I came to say goodbye.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Wait! I'll go with you!
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
Hey, there she is...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Partnership?
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
There's nothin' to talk about.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Thanks.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah...
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Yeah?
I'll keep it in mind.
Georgia.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
I lost them, that's what happened.
You're not getting any navy contracts.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
We can reach an understanding on this.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Please, we hardly know each other.
No.
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
What's that long building over there?
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
You what?
What?
Who indeed...
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
It is not your company.  It's a public company.  And I am going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Expected... offer.
You're making the right decision, sir.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
How?
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
What's that?
You looking' for some company?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sure.  For five bucks.
That's ridiculous.
The price just went up to ten.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Sit... and spin.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
Nice car.  Yours?
No.
Stolen?
Not exactly.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
You're not from L.A., huh?
New York.
Hotel.
Okay, what hotel?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
It pays.
So do day jobs.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For the whole night?
For an hour.
You're joking.
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
No, but it's getting there.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
You couldn't afford it.
Three hundred.
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Edward... you got it!
Get in.  This side.
You know how to drive a stick?
Better believe it.
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
Why?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Room service.  What do you drink?
Diet coke.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Can I have some chips?
And a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Do you plan everything?
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Fair enough.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
I've known a lot of everybody.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
It's a very good year.
Oooh, thank god.
Why?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Yes...
What do you like?
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay you three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Good morning.
No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?
Did you sleep well?
Occupational hazard?
Where'd you go?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Mmm, I could tell.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
No?  Why's that?
Occupational hazard.
I buy companies.
No shit.  They expensive?
... dollars?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
I sell them.
What?  Why?
What are assets?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Not... quite.
Where'd you learn to do this?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Don't drown.
All right.  How much for the week?
What?
I'm in town until Saturday.
It'd cost you.
Of course.  How much?
Four thousand.
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Done.
Holy shit.
I'm not just talking about sex.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
No, I don't got it.  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
This isn't a date.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
The Rex.
Any good?
I think you'll approve.
Thank you very much.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Oooh!
I'm sorry.
And that's the way the game is played.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
You're upset, huh?
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
You liked the guy, though.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Television?
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Uh-uh.  No work.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Why not?
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Was someone rude to you?
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Okay.
Good.
Come with me?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Please.
What about dinner?
Dinner can wait.
You always been rich?
No.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
You still mad at'm?
He died a long time ago.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
You did.
Real genuine guy.
He's good at what he does.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Ready to stomp sod?
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
Vivian, what the --
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Stuckey!  He wants an appointment with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Vivian...
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Fuck off.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
I really am sorry.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
What's that?
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
Edward, I can't.
Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
You won't.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
Where are you taking me!?
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Huh?
The opera.
I've never been on a plane before.
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
But don't they have it in English?
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
I more than liked it.
Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, Come on baby
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
I've never treated you like a whore.
You just did.
What did you do to him?
What do you mean?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you liked him.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Right.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
It was a business decision.
I got tired of hating my father.
It was good.
It felt good.
You're packing.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Aw, don't... no...
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
I didn't think so.
Vivian...
It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
Thank you.
Afternoon.
What's up, where you going?
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Cynthia's not coming?
No.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
I want to.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Oh, god, what?
I'll bring it back.
I'm here.
I know a lot of nice girls.
What!?
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
What time's diner tonight?
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
No one you know.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
We're letting them slide?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
But, Edward...
Do it.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
We just did.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Yes...
Doing what?
Vivian's in sales.
Why do you want to know?
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
You're being ridiculous.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Goodbye, Bill.
I'm up.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Why?
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and we got him.  You there?
Give me twenty minutes.
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
I don't think there's any sense in --
Let him answer.
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
What!?
Have a good day, gentlemen.
You broke my nose.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
All this because of that whore!
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I bet.  That was our rent!
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Looks slow tonight.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
He's not gonna want us.
'Lo.
Kit!  Where've you been?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Why'd he want you?
He... he just does.
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on him.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Was that you?
Who did you think?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Yeah.  I just got it.
Kit...
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
Where do you fit?
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
It was great.
Dummy.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
I pray for that.
Go for the bucks.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
What kind of school?
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a B.  Lift your dress and an A you'll see.
Want a pair of boots?
Do I!?  Momma!
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Couple a hours.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
Yeah, what?
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Okay.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
Oooh, I love those.
Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
I'm just going to my room.
I... Edward...
Niece?
I got a dress.
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Will I like it?
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
But I always eat like this.
Hmmm... I vonder vich.
I like steak.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
I'm just looking, thanks.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
I'm going to spend money.
Do you remember me?
I was in here yesterday.
Having a good time, Vivian?
Yeah.  Thanks.
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
What?
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
I just might do that.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Then I'm here till I die?
Then why bother curing me?
So it's to be torture.
You don't believe me?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship Revenge. Promise to return him to his ship.
My Westley will always come for me.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
Every ship but the four you sent.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
Should I be?
I do not marry tonight.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
He knows I do not love him.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
You mock my pain!
And what am I?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
As you wish.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
As you wish.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Can you move at all?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
I told you, I would always come for you. Why didn't you wait for me?
Well ... you were dead.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
I will never doubt again.
There will never be a need.
We'll never survive.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
Singed a bit, were you?
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship Revenge is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, All right
No. No. We have already succeeded.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
Gently.
Gently!!
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
It never happened.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, Man and wife.
Did you say, I do?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
I could kill you now.
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
You're quick.
Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Who's Guilder?
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Am I going mad or did the word think escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Anybody want a peanut?
I only dog paddle.
Veer left. Left. Left!
Faster!
I thought I was going faster.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
Probably he means no harm.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
If there are, we'll all be dead.
Hello.
True!
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
Yeah?
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
How many could you handle?
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- what? --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
The Man in Black?
-- Fezzik, please --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
The body?
Have you any money?
I have a little.
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
You've been mostly dead all day.
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Over the Albino, I think.
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Right, right, sorry.
What?
I hope we win...
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
I'll be right back.
Open it up.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
-- wait, just wait --
Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Do you want me to go on with this?
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
You want me to read this or not?
I don't understand.
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
As you wish...
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
It will not happen!
DEATH FIRST!!
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Your guess is as good as mine --
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
And our assets?
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
There we cannot help you.
Why? You can't even lift one.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
Now?
Not yet.
Light him.
Where's Fezzik?
I thought he was with you.
No.
In that case --
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
-- offer me money --
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
He's already dead.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Sixty-five.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
He's dead. He can't talk.
What's that?
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Thank you for everything.
Slow going?
Sorry.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
We'll wait until you're ready.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, Hello
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
You are wonderful!
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
Because I know something you don't know.
I am not left-handed.
I ought to be after twenty years.
Tell me.
Who are you?!
I must know.
Okay.
Kill me quickly.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
You're sure nobody's following us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
What?
Go in, get after her!
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
Inconceivable!
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
I didn't have the time.
I want to duel him left-handed.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Oh, have it your way.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Morons.
For the Princess?
I accept.
I smell nothing.
Hmm.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
Congratulations.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name?
Of the silvery moon,
I want to croon,
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
I'll wait in the hall ...
Oooooooops!
Ooooooops.
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Scared.  Can't talk.
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady.
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Do the books!  Do the books!
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
I have hurt your feelings.
Good, what is it?
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Well, sir, it seems ...
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Here, don't panic.
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Mr. Bialystock ...
Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
Where?  What?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
But that's cheating!
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Help!
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Yes, what?
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
What was I saying?
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Yes, it's quite possible.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
What do you mean?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
What did I do?
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
But what if the play was a hit?
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
What scheme?
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
You're going to jump on me.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
What???
I'm not going to jump on you!
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Well, you know what they say, Smile and the world smiles with you.  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Oh.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Right.
What kind now, Leo?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Two pistachios, my good man.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
It won't run a week!
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Who wrote it?
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
There it is... in red and white! Springtime For Hitler
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Okay, take it off, take it off.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
They'll say, Oooh
What is she gonna do here?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Do you think he'll take the job?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
To failure!
To failure!
Maybe it's not true!
No way out.  No way out.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
I never should have listened to you.
Double.  Double.  Double.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
Shut up.
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Liebkind, no!
Max, I...
What is it?
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Don't help me.
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
My play?  You mean, Springtime For ...  you know who?
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
No kidding?
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Good.  I will make the preparations.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Vaaaat???
But he has long hair!
I don't know.  I don't know.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Not.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Always.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Do you need us?
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
No.  We go.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Very nice girl.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Here I come, ready or not.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
Nietzche...
Bismark...
Hindenburg...
The Blue Max...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt.
Deutchland, Deutchland ...
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Vat?
People can hear you.
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Okay.
Where are you going vit the light?
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
Right, that checks out here.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
What flickering light?
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
Eventual supernova.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
Look, bomb...
What's he doin'?
I think he's talking to it.
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
It didn't go off.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
Yeah.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
We've got to disarm the bomb.
What was that, I didn't hear...
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
What the hell?
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Time to start talking.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Fuck that shit.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Well, there's the possibility of...
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
All right, then...
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
I read the same here.
Rechannel all safety relays --
-- open quantum latches --
Talby, can you read me?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Arm yourself, bomb.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Energy shielding positive function.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
Thanks.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
No.
You are false data.
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Bomb?
Snap out of it, bomb.
Hey, bomb...
And I saw that I was alone.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
I'll help you out.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
Well of course I exist.
But how do you know you exist?
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Right!
This is fun.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Exactly.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That's it.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
To explode, of course.
And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Of course not.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Hmmm...
So if you detonate in...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
I'll check it.
Pinback...
Yes, Doolittle.
Doolittle...
Yes.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
In a second.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
Naah. All stable.
What are you gonna name it?
What?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Shit.
Commander Powell would have named it.
Commander Powell is dead.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Fred.
Wha?
I hereby name this star Fred.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Veil nebula.
Who cares?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- open circuit breakers --
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
Remark.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Oh, sure.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
TALBY!
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
I need a diameter approximation.
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
I like it up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Billy Bear...
You know what I think about, Talby?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Not now!
Doolittle! Help me.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Guess you're right.
Oh yeah?
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Phoenix?
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Oh well.  How about you.
You!
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
You promise you won't tell?
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
I told you, my car broke down.
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
Janet!
Rocky!
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
So please don't tell me to can it.
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
Yes.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Yes.
I've got something to say.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Oh Brad.
Oh Janet
For you.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Dammit, Janet.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Ah... pity, pity...
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Well, what you might try is --
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
What was that bang?
Oh...
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
I'm coming with you.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Yes.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Right!
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Who are all these?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Oh Brad.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Weiss.
Brad...
It's alright Janet.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
No, don't do that.
Oh don't be so shy.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
I hope so my darling.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
Good God.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Sir?
Phenomenology...
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
I didn't make him for you
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Makes you cry
What guy
Makes you cry
From Transexual Transylvania.
So come up to the Lab.
On the day I went away.
Was all I had to say
Want to come again and stay
Men... men... what happened, men?
Like I'm outside in the rain
Free to try and find a game
You're too kind.
Are you - giving a party?
Oh, lucky him.
Who's Eddie?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
Yeah...
Well, I'll be...
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
So where is it then?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Shoulda guessed.
A tweeting bird?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a dame who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a dame who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
One of  em's in the slam.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Bastards put him on notice.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
He's a Toon... who cares?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
He's a riot.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
So you decided to help him after all?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
What was that?
That was the rabbit's wife.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Maroon, right?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
Sounds like singin'.
Oh, no...
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
I'll bet.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Ask her...
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
They must've taken it off me.
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Oh, not that downtown.  Toontown.
You're not takin' me to downtown Toontown?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
So you're Cloverleaf?
No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
What the hell's a freeway?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
You?
That's right, me.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Toon cops worked me over.
What am I, Earl?
No...
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
So altruistic.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
You shot Roger.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Where is he?
He's right here in the...
So where is it?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
A joker to the end.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Hold on a second.
Eddie, come on.
That's what you woke me up for?
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
What a gasser.
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
What's with the dip?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
So what do you want me to do?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I don't work in Toontown.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
So's the job.
Aren't you the lucky one...
When will I hear from you?
As soon as is humanly possible.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Sure, Valiant, sure...
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
I've already seen your photographs.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Have you got the will?
Maybe.  Why?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Valiant!  You surprised me.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Aah!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Don't ever forget that.
Does this help?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Well, no, not any time.  Only when it was funny.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
How do you know that?
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Me.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
What is this, Twenty Questions?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Safe?
Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
I'll get it.
Wrong number?
No, it's not.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
I rest my case.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Yeah?
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
Yeah...
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Yeah?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Good idea.
Keep reading...
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Only time will tell.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
So do you...been a long day.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Bullshit red tape.
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
I got to wait for a call.
What?
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
What the hell is that?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
What??  Where'd you hear that?
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
I'd like to see you try.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
What?
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
This is your ship?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
El Capitan?
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was Red Dragon.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Yeah, that's right.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
I said get on your feet!
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
Lee, you okay?
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
I said that?  Which word was goat?
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Carter, would I lie to you?
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
No.
Bathroom.
Carter, get off that stage!
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
I knew you were lying.
I'm sorry.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
What'd I say?
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
Try to land on your feet.
You lied to me.
I'm sorry.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
This won't take long.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
I am a tourist.
Hello.
How you doin'?
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
What are you doing?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Well, hurry up.
What's wrong?
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
This is a very dangerous man.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
I'm calling for back up!
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Don't look at my ass!
Where are you going?
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
It's my job!
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
I have plenty of dates.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Carter?
Who died?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Not Yu.  You!
Who?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
I'm okay, you go.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
What the hell is going on here?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Forget it.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
Ask me if I give a shit.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
No, no, that would be crazy --
You thought the Customs Agents get blown up and smuggling and Ricky Tan and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
IT IS CRAZY!
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
What?
I cannot go to LA...
It sounds impossible --
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Why LA?
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Almost, but you've got to say Rich White Man all run together like it's one word.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Who?
How do you know he's our man?
You sound like that all the time.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
He'll be back soon.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
It's a long story.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
No.  It was my singing.
Excuse me?
She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
Slow down, baby.
What did you say?
Nothing.  I said nothing.
Is it hot in here?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
What's going on?
She's getting undressed.
Gimme the binoculars.
No.  It's not right.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
What's she doing?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
I don't understand?
She's walking back towards the door.
Pick it up!
It's your turn!
I don't need a turn!
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
Take it!
I wouldn't do that!!!
Let me see it again?
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
She saved our lives.
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
Shhh, my head hurts.
I'm about to be killed and you Shhh me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Why did you help me?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not used to having a partner.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
Well we're not friends.
Fine with me.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Fine.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Yes.  We have heaven.
What's a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
I think we should stop talking.
Fine by me.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
Mind your own business.
How was the sex?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Steamed dumplings?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Are you serious?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
Very nice.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Hello, Benjamin.
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
Now that I believe.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
End of the line.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Vegas...
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Red Dragon.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Let's go.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
What is Mac out?
Follow me my Asian brother.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Dancing?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
No.  I'm going to find out.
Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
I'll give it my best shot.
Lee!
MMMMMM!!!!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
I did!
No you didn't!
Ricky Tan is alive.
What?!?!
We have to get to the Penthouse.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
Carter...
Just GO!
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
It's worth it to me.
We made it, man.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
That your gate down there?
Yes.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
What is this?
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
It's okay, I got lots more.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
New York City?
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Fine with me.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Is this a payoff?
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
Put your arms around me.
Excuse me?
What's going on?
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
You move well.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
No.  But I'll help you.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I didn't know which side you were on.
Now you know.
Baby Duck?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Do you still have the bills?
It's my responsibility.
The Secret Service?  Why?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Did you tell Sterling?
Thank you.
I'll take him.
You must come with me for questioning.
Don't.
The police can protect you.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Yes, Master.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Ricky Tan?
I know, Master, but...
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my still.
Lee!  It's him!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
OK. Say what it is.
Sir, I can explain.
I know, but --
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Feds asked for me?
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
He stole my wheel!
Tell me about it.
So was I.
You talk very fast.
Beach Boy.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
You have one of these?
No.
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
A little.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
We are both full of shit.
Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
What the hell is that?
What?
I was being polite.
Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
Witnesses.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
It was not my intent --
Right....
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
What about them?
Shortcut?
You don't know what a shortcut is?
You make the plate?
What plate?
No.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
No. I just made it up.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Stooly.
What?
Stool pigeon.
Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
You talk too fast.
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
Took off. Yes. They took off.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Yeah, it's good.
That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.
You want more?
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Ã®scuse me.
Now, that's American music.
Yes, I know this song.
You know War?
Who does not know War?  â”‚War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.â–“
Yes, I think so.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Yee-aww.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Good God, ya'll!
No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.
Are you OK?
I got to stop that dancing in the street Ã®till all hours.
Want some?
No, fish is a PM food.
Excuse me?
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
What?!
It's him.
Going into the restaurant.
This concrete?  This is still America.
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
I am from outa town.
No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
Like that.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
No, please, I don't --
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh yes.
Oh no, I dropped it.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Lee.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
What are you doing here?
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Oh no.
What?
The art.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
Oh my god. Griffin.
You know him?
What a surprise!
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my Ã®hood.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Not anymore.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
The Feds?!
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
No...what?
I could get promoted right out of here.
I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?
How'd what go?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
They put you in charge?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Ã®em.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
Oh my god...what happened to you?
It's called a dress.
It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
You don't like it?
It's okay. For restaurants.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Not to me. Never to me.
How about a lift home?
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Any demands yet?
At this point we don't have much.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
He is the situation.
I'm talking about the girl.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
What kind of assignment is that?
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Carter, shut up!
Yo, Johnson...
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
That's what you were supposed to be!
Hmmmm?
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
What?!
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
You a cop or something?
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
You got a boy friend in here yet? Ã®Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Where do we find him?
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Carter, can I have a moment?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
I still have work to do here.
I was trying to find the right time.
What is he up to now?
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
You don't understand this guy.
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
Right.
Yes.
Ahh.
You bet ya, Coach.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
How about -- I hope you'll be very happy together?
Thank you.
Really?
Got any last minute advice?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
What did he ask?
And what did you say?
Good one!  Thanks.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Of course.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Eight is good... V could be Victory.
It's hurting.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? Be the ball.
Never say die.
His hair... any color.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
What?
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Maggie!
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
Or a vegetarian?
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
In vino veritas.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
All the gory details.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Don't say spec like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
I don't know.
You're coming here?
Yeah.
Then come for dinner.
Okay, we'll order out.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Of course we are.  Of course.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Thanks.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
I don't think that's why she ran.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Oh, please!
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
Are you a reporter?
What?
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Looking for Maggie.
I think you'd look good in red.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Have you listened to his morning show, Wake up with ballplayer?
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
That must have made you proud.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Thank you.
They made me put my hat back on.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
You know, your daughter seems...
Originality is my speciality.
Excellent.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
You'll answer my questions?
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
You have one?
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
You're going to be very disappointed.
We'll see.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
That's fair.
Everest.  Is that right?
Twice...
Really?
Without oxygen...
We think so.
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
He is not!
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You can turn that finger around.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
When? How?
Really.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Too much.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
Done.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Cindy the manicurist.
I think so.
You afraid to try?
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Always a mood killer.
Still sweet.
It's a little Silence of the Lambs for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
I'm a work in progress.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, So
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
I don't know.
You don't know.
No.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Agreed.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
I'll have the same.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
You know, there's no...
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
No.  You take it.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Can you fix it?
Of what?
Kind of isolated.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Where did you disappear to?
Missed me bad, huh?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
Excuse me?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
Yes.
I don't and I don't think you should...
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
You humiliated me!
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Brian told you that?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Lost!
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
What!?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
That's called changing your mind.
Yes I do!
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
I'd rather not.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I kissed him back.
About a minute...?
A little longer for me.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me, either.
I love you.  I love you.
I love you, too.
To who?  Are you asking me?
Me?
Yes, you!
And the church.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I'm okay with that.
So am I.
So, we'll...
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
Yes, I did.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
Used?
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
This is getting serious.
I was, because if you said yes right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I'm listening.
I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
You're a goddess!
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Reporter?
Yup!
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Ya think?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Where?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those sources say things.
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Lighten up, wahine.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
It's for the bell.
Grandma!
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a V.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Not eight...
Let's go.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Okay.
What are you talking about?
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
Not this one.  This one's on me.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Thank you, Dad.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No.  It's my life.
What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar.... I can't ready anymore.
No, you tell her.
No.
Yeah.
Is there somebody else?
You take the microwave?
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
I hate boats.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
But it's on the water.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
-- who's married to --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
They're going to love you.
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Is that all right with you?
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Nope.
Even when you were young?
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
I'll wait.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Happy New Year, darling.
Happy New Year.
Walter, I'd love to --
We'll stay at the Plaza --
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
What is it?
It's delicious, trust me.
Who is it?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
And then I'll see you in New York --
You go.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
What?
About forever.
No.
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
You couldn't.
I do.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
Walter.
It was my mother's.
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
So what happened?
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
Oh!
What?
Look!
You should write something about this.
About what?
Whatever it is.
It's not true, but it feels true.
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
What was that about up there?
What was what?
Nothing's with me.
Sleepless in Seattle?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Actually, he sounded nice.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
Dear Sleepless and Son...
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows --
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? I know that's a dumb way to begin
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Right.
I should say something in this about magic.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Can too.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
I know.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
I always wondered about that too.
Hello.
Turn on your radio!
What?
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
Definitely.
What am I wanted for?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
You told a lie and got on a plane.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
Becky?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you.  I love you.
Good night.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I love that dream.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
He said hello.
It's a sign --
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
Becky?
So I mailed your letter.
Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle.
M.F.E.O.?
Made for each other.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
You're going to miss the train.
No, I'm not.
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I love the symphony.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
No, I know that part --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
I know.
I know.
I want my money.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Come on, Jonah --
Are you Annie?
Yes.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
Walter and I are engaged!
We'll move them --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Are his folks nice?
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
How did it happen?
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
How amazing.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Destiny takes a hand.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
What?
You know.
Magic.  It was magic.
Magic.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Mom!
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom, we already...
Like... clockwork.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's a sign.
You don't believe in signs.
Sure you do --
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Magic.
Magic.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Shhhh --
It's me?
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Why me? What about Jay?
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Hello.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
All righ...
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.
Have you had any relationship since?
No.
Why not?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, your response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
What's she talking about?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
What are you going to do, Sam?
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just knew.
What was it that made you know?
I don't think I could really describe it.
Why not?
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling.
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
It's not that late in Seattle.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
You don't like the one he was now?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Where's your mom?
She died.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
And you're worried about him.
No.
Why not?
You want me to talk to him?
Is he home right now?
Yeah.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
I don't know --
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Fair enough.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
You mean, like, He has the cutest butt? Where did I hear that recently?
Seventy... eight.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
What's tira misu?
What is it?
You think so?
Yeah.  What's that?
I don't get it.
Eighty dollars.
Window.
I don't know.  Do I?
What is it?
There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
I don't think I have to now.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
It's a spice rack.
Dad?  About last night?
Right.
Not.
My feelings exactly.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
It plays in 50 states.
What?!
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Oh, you're changing your mind --
No, I'm not, but --
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Does red pepper go under R or P?
P.  Dad?
What?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Fine.  Fine.
So I can go.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
Stressed.
Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
They called and asked for it.  Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on.
How did they get our phone number?
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF--  What is that?
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa. Where is that? --
Somewhere in the middle.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
She's willing to fly anywhere.
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She is my third grade teacher!
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
English muffin.  How do you do it?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
What do you think?
Will she scratch up your back?
What?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
Go to sleep.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says Paul is dead.
I know.
How do you know?
It was sinking.
What was?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Bye bye blackbird.
Is that what she used to sing?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I don't know.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I'm starting to forget her.
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
This one's for both of us.
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Great.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut.
This is a good letter, Dad.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Just this one part, okay?  I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember
Jonah, I'm leaving --
WAIT!!!  -- and while we're on the subject
Dad!
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Oh, right.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Perfect.  We'll be there.
There she is.
She's going to cook something for us?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
It's only ten o'clock.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
Don't ever do that again.
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
That's true.  Why is that?
Did you call that radio station again?
No.
Everyone at work heard you.
I just called for a second.
It's a short word.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Was Mom an adjustment?
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
God, she's beautiful.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Who is Annie?
The one who wrote us.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Have you seen my wallet?
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Are you going with her?
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
This is the one I like.
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
What's wrong with Annie?
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
This conversation is finished.
You said we could go to New York.
Did not.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Get out.
No.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
What if I couldn't get to you?
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn't go.
No.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
No.
I can't believe you flew first class.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Okay.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Sure.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I still don't think it's loaded.
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
What about camping?
Do you like it?
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
I think they're announcing your flight.
Hi.
Yes?
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Microwave.  Five minutes.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
What do you mean?
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
You did?
You could have called me --
You are the first woman I'm going out with.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
He's ten.
I read an article about this ...
Sure.  Sure.
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Thanks, miss.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Huh?
What the hell is that?
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Who's Whiskey Dick?
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
You love him?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
Hawk.
Got any KISS?
Yeah, a man's drink...
What's that?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Whoa... she is a killer.
I'm all wet.
What's wrong with that?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
I-I c-can't...
Thanks.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Beth? I can't believe it.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Ann Arbor?
That I'm used to.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Bye.
What's it worth to you?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Whatever... stella.
What are you, high?
Yeah.
For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Our band Mystery is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
What's the profile?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
How can you, how can you say that?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
What's in Sandusky?
Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
Yeah.
You're tough, J-man.
I'll be in my office.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
That's unlikely.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
But you never had a first date.
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
What's a scam?
Going out as friends.
Then what's love?
I'm gonna call her.
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Look at those eyes.
Lloyd, give it up.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Lloyd.
C'mon, just do it.
C'mon Lloyd.
Please?
That's just so embarrassing.
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front.
Okay, I got it.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Hang in there, man.
See you tomorrow.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Did you sleep with her?
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
So, what's your point?
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Alright.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
I already did.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
No, you're not a guy.
I am.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, You're a real live-wire
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Lloyd is doomed.
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd.  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
You like it?
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
What are you doing?
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I love you dad.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
One more time in English.
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Okay, I give up.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
I know that.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
You're not listening to me.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
I like him a lot.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
Dad, I love him.
Any luck?
Plenty, but it was all bad.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Dad, are you okay in there?
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
But I found the money.
What am I supposed to think?
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
Yes, I...
No, but you stole from them.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
You're right.
Hello.
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Mom, please?
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
You will?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Look at those eyes.
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
No, I read it on the message.
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Are you busy on Friday?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Are you busy on Saturday?
So you're monumentally busy?
Well, not monumentally.
Hmmm....
Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party.  This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
Actually, I think that I...
Well...
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
I'll go.
Pardon me?
I'll go.
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Eight.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Whoa.
Would you hold this for me?
Yeah
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
No.
Keymaster?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
So it's an honor?
No.
So we can finally talk?
Yeah.
He does this every year?
It's the worst job since keymaster.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Have a good sleep.
Bye.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; Glad I finally met you, You always seemed nice, Wish I could have known you more...
Mine say stuff like Lloyd
Nobody knew me before tonight.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
That's cool then.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Sure I do.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Watch out for that glass.
Twisted?
You know what?
Basic.  Hmmm.
So what's your job this summer?
Job?  Being a great date.
No, I'm serious.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.
Then call me later.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
YO, DOOFUS!
Yeah.
Nice one.
You think so?
After work?
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Won't you see me later?
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Me?  Sure I do.
Come on.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Stop by later.
Okay, bye.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
You have to meet Bess.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
Yes.
What did you say?
Well... just meet her.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
No.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Be friends?
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Am I wrecking my car?
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Oh.  I was putting the...
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
Are you comfortable?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
No.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
No, we don't have to say it.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
Say what?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Well, I need to study, and...
Yeah.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions.
We'll see.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Okay, what did we just decide?
We decided...
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No, no.
It sounded like you did.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Yeah you do.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
You shared it with a dick.
No I didn't.
Is this because of your dad?
No.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Did you tell anybody?
Just my dad.
You told your dad?
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
Oh shit.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
You do?
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
I love you.
What?
One more time would be nice.
I'm fine.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Check!
Okay.
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Okay.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Good to know.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Okay.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Not right now, thanks.
How's it going?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
I know.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Uh... okay... um...
No.
No.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
How do you pay for one of those?
I'm totally and completely serious.
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I know.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
I know this part, keep reading.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
My car.
Diane Court.
Whoa... she just farted.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Weird...
What?
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Hey.
What?
Yeah.
I called her up.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
Alright.  Key?
How you doin', brother?
Oh, I was just going to...
I was gonna...
I was just going to kind of move around.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
Alright!
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
I love you too.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Yeah, alright.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Damn straight we are.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Curly.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
What the fuck!
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
DUDES!
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all re-enter the concerto. Voila!
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
I found the Volvo.
Tickets?
No... You don't think...?
Nah. Couldn't be.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Could be.
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Dude, this is all I got.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Jam, listen up.
Hawk?
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
You sure you want me to?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Cool.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
They're what?
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Check.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Thanks for the coffee.
Guess people ought to know who I am...
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
I got...
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Go ahead, Jam.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
Oh, hi, mom.
Uhh... nothing.
Ahh, sunshine.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
But, mom!
They're not idiots.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
I said, I'm sorry!
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Yeah.
No.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
I did it! I did it! We won!
We won?!
The Chinese have a proverb: That which appears too good to be true
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us
Simplicity, Hawk.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Hello summer detention.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
Let's lift up her shirt.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
It's gone.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
But we took the keys?
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
Twenty-five more'n I got.
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
What do you want?
Look, you can have my wallet...
That girl -- I --
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Two hundred bucks?
Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
The KISS Army!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Neither do I!
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
You did not like the speech?
NedÃ I knowÃ I know
Ah
Thank you, Ned.
You are a gentleman.
OhÃ what have I done?
Follow that boat!
Yes.
Really?
Do you know that house?
Lady?
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
We have no Juliet!
See you in jail.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Ten pounds.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Done.
Words, words, wordsÃ once, I had the giftÃ I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesÃ for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunneryÃ but now
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Nothing comes.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
yet cannot love nor write it.
Will it restore my gift?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Yes, I saw it.
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
That's me.
And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
When?
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Take his feet out. Where will you get
Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.
Cut his nose off.
And his ears.
Partners!
It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
What's the title?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Good title.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
A share of the profits.
There's never any
Of course not!
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterÃ Almost finished?
This time we take your boots off!
Oh, that.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
So what do we do?
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
How?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Where is the play?
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
Yes, but very well.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Nobody knew!
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
No Juliet?!
What happened to Sam?
Every word.
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
It is all locked safe in here
God be praised!  Locked?
Who is she this time?!
She is always Aphrodite.
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
What piece? Richard Crookback?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Fifty pounds? What for?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
No, then.
To my weekly confession.
Now where? Will?
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
I feel a scene coming on.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Will! Have you finished?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
I did not.
Tomorrow
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Nobody. The author.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Cut round him for now.
What? Who?
The one who came with your letter?
What?
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
By God, I wish I knew.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
I don't know, it's a mystery.
Another little problem.
What do we do now?
The show must Ã  you know
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
How will it?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Kit
Wonderful, wonderful.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I love your early work. Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
Good title.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Do you think?
MercutioÃ good name.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
This is a different one.
Two hours at prayer!
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
Not ready? Where is she?
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
I am not so well-born.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Your Majesty.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
And I love poetry above all.
Oh, but they can!
Your Majesty
Your Majesty!
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
I have lost my gift.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Is she obedient?
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
You have opened the playhouses?
Better fortune, boy.
You admire it?
Oh. What is your name?
I have to get back.
My lady!
Who is there?
Will Shakespeare!
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
The same, alas.
Oh but why alas?
A lowly player.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Oh--I am him too!
Oh my lady, my love!
Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a fool?
Can you love a player?
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
I am.
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
I do not know how to undress a man.
It is strange to me, too.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
There is.
Even your play.
And that was only my first try.
Well perhaps better than my first.
You would not leave me?
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Moonlight!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It was the owl--come to bed
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Let him be damned for his pages!
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
Oh, do not go
I must. I must
Oh, Will!
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
That's my line!
Oh, but it is mine too!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
Then I will go with you.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
Will! What--?
A literary feud. Quite normal.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
You never spoke so well of him.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
You lie.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
I was the more deceived.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
You cannot marry Wessex!
NoÃ no.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
An excellent beginning  Let him beÃ a duke. And your heroine?
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?Ã she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeÃ Orsino.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
and thus unable to declare her love
I don't know. It's a mystery
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
Nor you for me.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
Write me well.
My lady Viola.
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
My lady VIOLA.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
I do not love you, my lord.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Virginia?!
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
The Queen has consented?
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
I meanÃ Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
Lady Viola isÃ young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
He is dead?
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
Where did you learn how to do that?
Wait there.
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
Do you understand me?
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
And break her heart and mine?
She loves me, Thomas!
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Your aunt?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
Poet?
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
How do I offend, my lord?
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
Here we come at last, my lord!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
A theatre poet?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
That dog!
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
You are on my ground.
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
Serve.
Just serve.
In the same fashion as chess.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You're a bad loser.
I haven't lost yet.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
What do you think?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I'm only asking what you think.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
He made it clear.
Why, thank you, David.
Only on expenses.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
Have you seen him?
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
No.
No.
Think about it.
Come on, David.
You mean immoral.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
You think so?
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
He's still here.
He couldn't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
And what about you?
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
So who's going to do it?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I can't do it.
I don't hear this.
I won't be able to.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Take his legs.
I don't know.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Finished.
But not quite.
Is that going to be deep enough?
Is this necessary?
That was good.
Can we talk about something?
Not now. I have an idea.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
Just stop worrying.
I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Now.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
How much?
I don't know.
What is this?
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a break-in.
Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
Doesn't it worry you?
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
What's all this for, more security?
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
What? Yes, that's fine.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
Not eating what?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
I want to secure it.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
You looking for me?
Looking for you? Yes.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
We just wanted to speak to you.
Who?
Your friends.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
I beg your pardon?
But they know.
They know.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Except the money.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
So I gathered.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
Not at all.
Yeah?
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
About the mail --
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Where do you think you'll go?
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
What?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
I don't know anything about it.
But there's no --
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
Is this being recorded?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
No. Why should it?
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Yes, I suppose so.
Well, is it?
What?
Parked outside?
That's it, then.
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
I see.
Right.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Cameron.
Cameron?
Yes.
Really?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Did you know --
Just serve.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
She hated you --
more than anyone she has ever met. in her whole life.
-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Who was it?
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
So we'll meet him, then?
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Aroused and inflamed.
Alex.
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
I'm not usually drunk.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
Which is a hack.
The man we know and love.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
Know and love?
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
You're right.
You see, they don't really know me.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
Have you seen Hugo?
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
David hasn't seen him either.
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
David?
Hugo.
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Open it.
You want me to kick it open?
Yes.
Now?
All right. No problem.
I wonder how he did it?
Did what?
Alex.
What? What's wrong?
I'm just looking.
Don't.
Don't look?
No.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Unfeasible.
Is that all?
Who's going to do it?
I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
And now you tell me.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
OK.
Be careful.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Sshh.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
Love and happiness for ever.
For ever and ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Who?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
You were magnificent.
Hello. Hello.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Are you all right?
Will you calm down.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
It tastes different.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
You know we're right.
Don't you?
I don't see the point in that.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
Leave him alone.
He can't stay up there.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
Your painful groin?
Later. But first -- him.
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Oh, good.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Forget it.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
And the money?
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Expecting anyone?
No.
Oh.
Aren't you going to answer it?
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
It's the only way.
You're frightened.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
You'll wait in the hall?
I'll wait there.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Alex.
What?
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
We were just sorting things out.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
Oh, shut up, Alex.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It's about me and David.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Don't you ever stop?
No.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
Interesting.
I see.
So, uh...
What?
What?
You were going to say something.
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
Can you afford this place?
Yeah.
What about?
It's about the burglary.
Burglary?
Of course.
Can we come in?
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
There are only two other people in the flat.
Two?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
No, three. Who said there were four?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Yes, absolutely.
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
I see.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Someone lost the key.
Is this where no one stays?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
No, I've never seen them.
You're sure of that.
Yes.
That wasn't a question.
Why do you want a room here?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Just a second, that's all!
Just get on with it, Alex.
Yes.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Do you know many of these people?
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
I'm sorry.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
What?
No.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?
If I think you're lying --
I thought you'd gone to work.
With a face like this?
I'm sorry.
I should hope so.
We already know. All about it.
It was on the television.
So let's go.
You and me?
Yes.
And you need your sleep.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What?
It wasn't like that.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Sorry?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Exactly what I was --
Eh --
I'm not sure --
Yes, sir.
I'm boring?
Hello.
What guy?
What guy that died?
Here?.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Hugo.
Would you like to come in?
I'd be delighted.
It's nice.
Would you like to see the rest?
What do you do?
What's it about?
A priest who dies.
I see.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
No.
Writing seems easy.
It's a breeze.
Do you think you could answer that?
The telephone? It continues to ring.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
No.
All right.
It was some guy called Brian.
Did he sound upset?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
It's an improvement.
Shall I answer it?
Working nights?
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
A certain weakness.
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
That sounds fine.
What?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Look again if you like.
No. I haven't seen them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Same as everyone else.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Yes.
Diseases.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Sorry?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Or a fake?
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
You real down?
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
How do you know?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Oh?
Well... thank you.
Perhaps.
Really?
What did who say?
You are so damn sexy.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Yes?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Joey -- do it.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
Chops?
Two days.  An hour or so.
Am I?
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
What is it, Mary?
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Hurry, Sister!
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Enough jabber.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
Shirelles.
Soprano or alto?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
I knew that.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Wet behind the ears.
Tell me about it.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Amateurs 2
Again!
She's a pro.
Come on, we're late.
I... I brought you something.
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
A novice.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Are you sure?
Mary Clarence!
We need experience.
Experience!  Right?
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Really?
Who are all these people?
I'm getting experience.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Mary Clarence!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
What?
I don't want to mess anyone up...
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
We're nuns!
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Are you leaving us?
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
There.
Where?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Whaddya think?
Let's go, Reggie.
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
Again?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Very well.
St. Anne's?
You were unhappy?
The reason?
I see.
Sit down.
Your cigarette -- out.
It has come to pass.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Check your driver's license.
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Would you like that?
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
Until sundown.
No food.  Not until sundown.
Yes.  Until breakfast.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Useless distractions.
Your cell is more than adequate.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
Mary Clarence!
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, Take up thy task
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
You're my Olympic event.
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
Out of the question.
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
The majority has spoken.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
I must go where I can be of use.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
Good day.
Saving you.  Move!
Oh?
I'm a Christian.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Don't push it.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
So I don't shop.
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
He didn't do you a favor.
Then-you run.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Get a stenographer.
Maybe Hawaii.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
I just need a few more weeks,
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
You're supposed to be hiding out!
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
I've been worried about you.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
Me too.
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
Vince knows you're here.
Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
What?
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
I think they'd understand.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Nuns?
What're you doing?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Then one day they find you.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
Where's who?
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
Maybe.
Take care of it.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
It's done?
What's the problem?
It didn't happen.
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
Well?
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
So, take it off.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
Willy -- hit the lights.
Joey?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
It should be here any minute.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
That should have tipped us.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Sister Mary Patrick?
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Really...
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Peace on Earth.
However, we can also pray for other things.
Measles.
Is this like your old convent?
Which convent was that, Sister?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
That was exciting!
He's not like other guys.
He's decent.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
It's better than ice cream.
It's better than springtime.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
It's brought people back to the church.
Ice cream!
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
An... entertainer?
She wasn't a nun?
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
She's our inspiration!
It's so beautiful...
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
But how do we get there?
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
A Benedictine.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Christy.
Impossible.
I don't understand.  Where is she?
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
She said they were from her old convent.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
But where?
Reverend Mother?
Yes?
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
But, Bishop...
I lied.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
Can you hold?  Can you try?
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Find 'em!
Three more hours...
Where is he?
Tell me.
You're impossible...
That's what I always say.
Is Mom okay?
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
She's right over there.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh God, I'm dead...
So, what do I say?
Simple. Just say, Mom
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Yeah, you betcha...
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Once a carnie, always a carnie.
Oh-yah.
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
You-betcha.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Loretta, never have kids.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
What is wrong with you?
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Really?
Okay.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
This came for you, sweetie.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
What!
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
No! At least I don't think I am!
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
An invitation?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
It's my birthday.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
And what are you, his chaperone?
Actually, I'm his father.
Like me, too.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Will that be cash or charge?
Better make it charge.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I confess.
I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
And your father? Is he from New York?
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Just like me.
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Not an easy book.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Jesus, what happened to you?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
What happened?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
I'd love to.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Forty-one pages.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Huh?
What's that, Sol?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, One corned beef sandwich
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
The Queen of England?
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
Yeah, I did.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
I didn't know you took pictures.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
How'd you get started?
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
A photographer ...
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
It's kind of overwhelming.
What do you mean?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
But they're all the same.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Slow down, huh?
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Hey, man, good to see you.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
How old, kid?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
All right, say Airport Ho-Jo.
Airport Ho-Jo!
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Fuck you, kid.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Not a peep.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
So what did he say when he called?
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Uh, better make it one.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Ah-hah.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Anything good?
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy?
Loretta, don't do that.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
You got it.
I'm all ears.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Every word.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Did you ever go back to see her?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
She probably died.
Yeah, probably.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Yes, I suppose I do.
What do you mean?
I mean, it's a good story.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Eighteen and a half years.
You're looking good, Auggie.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
It means happiness.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
You don't give up, do you?
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Where to?
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
You what?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
And what's that supposed to mean?
She looks just like you.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
No you're not.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Bully for you.
No, bully for you.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
What's this?
Why don't you open it and find out?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
Five thousand bucks.
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.  You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
There's just one thing I want to know.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
I almost got married once.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Lovely.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Seventeen.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
Sure thing. See you later.
A little. Not much.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
It's for you.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
What is this, some kind of joke?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
And why the hell would you give me money?
So I can get my job back.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
What difference does it make?
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
It'll never be finished.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: A woman is just a woman
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
What can I do for you?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
How the hell did you get into the building?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
You mean Rashid?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
I just want to know where he is.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
And his parents?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
I shouldn't have let him go.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
No thank you.
And?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned
Those are pretty hostile words.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Jesus.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
You going to sit here all day?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Just passing through.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Not a one.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
It was just a thought.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
What's your offer?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Benefits?
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, Cyrus
And have you mended them?
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Here, wh-wh-what?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Hi there, little brother.
Say hi to Paul.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
Thomas.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Thomas.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well?
Aren't you going to say anything?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
What are you talking about?
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Yah?
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
I owe you something.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
Rashid. Rashid Cole.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
I mean breakfast.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
Mostly what.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
That's where the what comes in.
The what?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
You can't be more specific than that?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Yeah, that's right.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I'm not people. I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Thanks, but I'll manage.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address.
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Yeah, I can believe it.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is your father an artist?
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
He's dead?
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Drawing's a good thing.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Shrink major, not a shrink.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
What time is it?
Eight-thirty?
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
How long have you been here?
Three nights.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Two or three nights.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Are you going to be all right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer.
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Appreciation for what?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where did you get that thing?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
You don't really want to know.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
And?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
Why don't you go to the police?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Thanks.
What time did you get to bed last night?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Come on, just a little hint.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
The inspiration.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
The end.
No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
Celebrate? What for?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
I just did.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Mrs. Leeman?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
I don't know.
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
Here, catch.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
That's it. In a nutshell.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
That money is my whole future.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
Well?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
No wonder he was angry.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
I'm not going to do it.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Hi, kid.
Research. I worked the scene right into my story.  That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
It's all right. I really do know them.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
red nose And ears. I know; I know.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
Medium rare, please.
Yes, please.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
Oh shit!
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Go on! Get out!
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Mom!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
What?!
Hard man to live with.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
That's no bull.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Let me tell you scary
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
C'mere. I love you so much.
I love you much.
Bye mom.
It's okay.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
I hate her!
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
This, this... This is bullshit!
Yes.  And that one, too.
I suppose you want a tip?
Bye.
Why?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Get lost, will you?
Bull fiddle.
Thank you ever so.
It's entirely mutual.
No --- how does it go?
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
You heard me. Where is it?
What happened?
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
I'll say.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Yeah.  Why?
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
You're right, Joe.
Of course I am.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
No we're not.
We're not?
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
But suppose he loses?
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
But suppose it doesn't?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Quiet - I'm thinking.
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
I told you - it's a sure thing.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
Yeah - where were you?
With you.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
Right.  We have the same blood type...
type O.
Nellie told us about it.
We're not too late, are we?
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
You've flipped your wig!
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
Josephine and Geraldine!  Come on!
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
I just did.
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
Knock it off, will you?
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
I think they got me.
They got the bull-fiddle.
You don't see any blood?
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
Where are we running, Joe?
As far away as possible.
That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
You going to call the police?
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
Shave our legs, stupid.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Oh, I'll get it. I'll get it all right. I might even take seconds.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
And I'm Daphne.
DAPHNE?
I never did like the name Geraldine.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
Watch it, Daphne!
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Now you've done it!
Done what?
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
You better come help me.
This way, Daphne.
Now you tore the other one.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Down, Daphne!
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
You tore it again!
Men?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
What are you doing?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Fight it.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Then pull the emergency brake!
Good night, Daphne.
Good night, Josephine.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
And I'm not even pretty.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
Blow where?
How can we?  We're broke.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
But this is so humiliating.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
This happens to me all the time in public.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
You know - the old shell game.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message.
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Oh, he does!
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
He's going to be ashore with you.
With ME?
That's right.
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
What are you doing with my flowers?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
I'm engaged.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
I am.
WHAT?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Security.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Jerry - there's another problem.
Like what?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Like when?
Like right after the ceremony.
Oh.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
What engagement present?
Hey - these are real diamonds.
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Joe -
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Okay, Joe.
Not that, you idiot.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
What do you think you're doing?
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
I may throw up.
Yeah - lets shove off.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
There you go with that we again.
Yeah...
Yes...
Yes, Leslie!
All right - so what do we do now?
Did you hear that?
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
What'll I tell him?
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
We're not on the pier yet -
Terribly sorry.
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
We'll take a rain check.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
Are my seams straight?
I'll say.
See you around, girls.
Good night, Sugar.
Good night, honey.
Honey - she called me honey.
Oh - Sugar!
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
If there's anything I can do for you -
Oh, I can think of a million things -
And that's one of them.
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Interesting.
No, no.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
That's ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
I'm a very sick girl.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I'm not that sick.
I have a very low resistance.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
I know where to get some.  Don't move.
You all right?
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
I may spill something.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
What's the surprise?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
Who needs vermouth?
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
Not you, Sugar.
I'm just going to get some ice.
I'll carry the instruments.
Thank you, Daphne.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
You betcha.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
What do you think you're doing?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
What's that?
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
Vanity Fair?
His yacht?
I'm a what?
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Yeah - Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
Then it must be Wednesday.
We don't have to run.
Oh yes, we do!
I guess she's not in here.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Well, I'll come back later.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
I met one of them.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
I hope so.
What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?
No!
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
No!
Yes.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
Did he get fresh?
What for?
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
How did you get that bracelet?
You like it?
I always did.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Thirty-four.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Brand new.
I know.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
I was it.
I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare.  Something I ate.  I'm not at all well.  See?  Hot water bottle.
It's about the Florida job.
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
We could dye our hair.
We could -
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
Help yourself.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
I am Cinderella the Second.
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
Me too.  Bye now.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
Personally, I'm Type O.
You don't say.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
You invest in shows?
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
I'm not surprised.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Bull fiddle.
Most of the time I slap it.
You must be quite a girl.
Wanna bet?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Why?
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
Goodbye?
This is where I get off.
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
Please.  It won't happen again.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
I'll throw up!
Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -
Who?
About that roadhouse -
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Daphne...
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
Pleased to meet you.
Come one!
Another bridesmaid?
Flower girl.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
It doesn't matter.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
I don't care.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
I forgive you.
And I can never have children.
We'll adopt some.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Well - nobody's perfect.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Are we on Cops again?
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Hi.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
I tell Annette, I says, You talk to me durin' my stories
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
You ain't going nowhere.
I don't like no witnesses.
We won't breathe a word.
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
Anything today?
Thank you.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
Because I got some plans -
And you'll be in all evening?
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
No, we couldn't!
We'll take it!
Well, here we are.
No - funerals.
We got it second-hand.
We got time off for good behavior.
Tell what?
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Where did he conduct?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
Running away?  From what?
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Put it here.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Then why did you take this job?
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Me?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Rough?
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Bingo?
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Really?
Every time!
Yeah.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
You don't say?
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Men!
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
Brains aren't everything.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
What's in Florida?
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
You're entitled.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Glasses?
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Happy days.
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
What's happened?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Why not?
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Not at all.
Thanks, honey.
Good night, Sugar.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
Saxophone player?
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
My fault.
You're not hurt, are you?
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Why?
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Now, really -
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Not at all.
Your face is familiar.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
That must be it.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
You have a yacht?
Which one is yours - the big one?
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
No, my flag steward.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
I'm not interested at all.
Well, I'm not.
That's very interesting.
Up, up, up.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
For your own amusement?
You're society girls?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Yeah.  Real hot.
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
Inauguration balls -
opening of the Opera -
riding to hounds -
And always the same four Hundred.
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
I beg your pardon?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
What theory?
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Tonight?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
You collect shells?
Shell Oil?
Would you mind moving along, please?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
If it's at all possible -
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
I got a hairdo.
Josephine.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
The most wonderful thing happened -
What?
Guess!
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
You don't say!
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Shells?  Whatever for?
I am?
Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
For me?  It's Shell Oil.
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
Been waiting long?
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It's the thought that counts.
I seem to be out of gas.
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
So? Be real easy.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Anyone?
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Love it.  Which way?
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
Oh - in here.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.
What is it?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
They shrink when they're marinated.
Champagne?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Bon voyage.
Look at all that silverware.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Where's your shell collection?
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
It's the crews' night off.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Completely.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
You're flattering me.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
What thing?
They just sort of leave me cold.
You mean - like frigid?
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Have you tried?
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
See?  Nothing.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
What happened?
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Oh, no!
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Talk about sad.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
You poor, poor boy.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Is it that hopeless?
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Have you ever tried American girls?
Why?
Is that anything?
Thanks just the same.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
Would you do me a favor?
What is it?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Anything this time?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
So inhale!
Well - ?
I think you're on the right track.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
I never knew it could be like this.
Thank you.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Mineral baths - now really!
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Good night.
Good morning.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Let's make it an even million.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Did you have a nice time?
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
We was robbed.
Okay. Take her purse.
Really?
From a rich millionaire.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Me?
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Tomorrow night?
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
You're not?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
Smart move.  Oh, by the way - did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
What's the matter, Sugar?
I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
Daphne -
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
I told you - I'm not very bright.
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
I know.  Every time!
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
I come to the old lady's funeral.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Annette, just use your hand.
Booze.
Coffee?
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
Go where?
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
I never join nothin'.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Big joke!
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Why?
I cut myself shaving.
You shave with your spats on?
I sleep with my spats on.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
And who runs it?
Refresh my memory.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Thanks, Charlie.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Why wouldn't I?
Well, we all got to go sometime.
What for?
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
ThereÃ†s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Except itÃ†s Scotch.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Christ, Amy.
Drunk isnÃ†t the same thing as happy, Amy.
Why donÃ†t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
Pub Golf?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
But I do. I will. YouÃ†re my sister.
What? Why? What do you mean?
Are you sure youÃ†re okay?
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
Wow. You look beautiful.
ItÃ†s not me. I swear. ItÃ†s her. SheÃ†s magic.
To make sure youÃ†re okay.
Actually, I do.
Still--
Or Kat....
WhereÃ†s Nick sleeping?
My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks itÃ†s--
Huh?
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now sheÃ†s getting married.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
She did?
Um, just about everyone.
ItÃ†s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
IÃ†m a hooker.
I had to say something to get you here.
IÃ†ll just check into a hotel.
Yeah, kind of.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
WhatÃ†s his problem?
ThereÃ†s something about him thatÃ†s just a bit odd.
No, thatÃ†s not it.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
And Kat was fully clothed.
ThatÃ†s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
I didnÃ†t deserve her back then.
Nothing.
Oh, hello.
Ah, a philosopher.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
You Yanks and your therapy. ItÃ†s great.  ItÃ†s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Hey, man.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
No, I canÃ†t. WeÃ†re late for a dance lesson. I guess youÃ†ll have to finish up later.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Hello, Katmandu.
Seeing you again....
Yeah?
Hey, yourself.  I see youÃ†ve met my ex.
Hey, you!
Let me guess. Amy presumed IÃ†d forget the rings.  I think IÃ†m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Maybe not her least... ThereÃ†s always--
So, tell me, howÃ†s unmarried life?
I have regrets.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, weÃ†re the past. IÃ†m not sure if you noticed, but IÃ†m here with someone else.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, thereÃ†s something not quite right.
ItÃ†s called character. God, youÃ†re predictable.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Kat, wait. I donÃ†t want you hating me. WeÃ†ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Um, news flash: I donÃ†t give a shit.
Kat, stop it. You do. You canÃ†t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
So, whatÃ†s your point?
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thatÃ†s a long time, isnÃ†t it?
Not for a dog.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Is this supposed to be an apology?
ItÃ†s not supposed to be anything, Kat. ItÃ†s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I donÃ†t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
YouÃ†re not even listening.
Brilliant.
ItÃ†s the past. ItÃ†s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then letÃ†s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
I slept with your sister.
IÃ†m sorry?
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. ThatÃ†s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Hi. Hey.
You think we look like weÃ†re trying too hard.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like weÃ†re trying too hard to look like we fit.  ItÃ†s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
What color are my shoes?
You have feet?
DonÃ†t patronize me. TheyÃ†ve clearly been at this a while.
YouÃ†re funny.
Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, itÃ†s way better to look hot while youÃ†re doing it.
Mission accomplished.
Really?  DonÃ†t get too attached.
Mmm.
Both.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyÃ†re naked.
I donÃ†t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in Ã´share.Ã¶ People do that.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramÃš.
He was pretty drunk, but I think heÃ†s still crazy about you.
Of course he is. IÃ†m here with my new man.  I love it! Your magicÃ†s already working. Let the suffering begin.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you donÃ†t think he wants me back?
I donÃ†t know.
What does your gut say?
YouÃ†re too good for him.
No, count it, anyway.
Why?
IÃ†m compulsive and weird?
Six thousand, right?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youÃ†re so cute, IÃ†ll take care of our incidentals.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
That wonÃ†t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
You quitting?
IÃ†m desperate to start but I donÃ†t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I canÃ†t get enough of.
Who are they?
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
What?
What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.
I do?
A weekend?
A wedding.
Not the way youÃ†re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
Not you. YouÃ†re not disgusting. YouÃ†re lovely. Just the idea that theyÃ†d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnÃ†t...who never.... I mean, someoneÃ†s dead.
This happened to you?
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
How did you know that was me?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Would you grab my shampoo?
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnÃ†t be violated.
You shit!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
And you thought IÃ†d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Yes.
What?!
Are you asking me if IÃ†m gay for pay?
I guess so.
What do you think?
ThereÃ†s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Ã´Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.Ã¶ Trust me, IÃ†m careful.
I love that youÃ†re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
DonÃ†t stop asking questions, okay?
Okay.
I swear. I donÃ†t have a signature move.
Oh, come on. YouÃ†re like the Yoda of escorts.
I disappear. ItÃ†s not about me.
ItÃ†s hard to explain.
Show me.
Come on.
IÃ†ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think itÃ†s the words: Ã´morally repugnant.Ã¶
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Is this for last night?
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
DonÃ†t they have a limit at those machines?
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?
But nothing did.
Yup. ThatÃ†s why you get to keep your money.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. ItÃ†s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youÃ†re not walking away!
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnÃ†t one of them.
IÃ†m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
You have had girlfriends?
Sure, but itÃ†s never easy. They say theyÃ†re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyÃ†re not.
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
When I said IÃ†d never done a wedding before, I didnÃ†t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
So, whyÃ†d you say yes to me?
Desperation?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Make out with you for free.
Spontaneously combust?
Yeah.
Fourteen and heÃ†s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
I didnÃ†t say he was worth it.
And thatÃ†s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
So whatÃ†s with the nickname?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
YouÃ†ve always got that to hide behind, donÃ†t you? ItÃ†s just business!
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, weÃ†ll go back to the real world and...and youÃ†ll be hiring me for your best friend!
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I donÃ†t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. ItÃ†s your job. ItÃ†s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
YouÃ†re judging me?! Oh, thatÃ†s a good one. YouÃ†re lying to me, youÃ†re lying to your family, and youÃ†re lying to yourself. But youÃ†re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youÃ†ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.
I should go.
What?! No, no. You canÃ†t--
I have to.  IÃ†m the best man.
Nice speech. I thought it was Ã´touchingÃ¶... and Ã´funny.Ã¶
Thank you.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Therapist.
You knew?
Hey, Sal.
I get all the glamour jobs.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Of course, donÃ†t be silly.
Dad!
Meet Nick.
ThatÃ†s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
ItÃ†s complicated, Dad.
Yeah.
IÃ†m worried. AmyÃ†s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it Ã¦drunkerÃ† or Ã¦drunker-erÃ†?
Ã´...but itÃ†s getting there. Ã´
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
I havenÃ†t thought about that in years.
SheÃ†s drunk. -er than me. But I didnÃ†t really dump you, did I?
IÃ†m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
I am now, sir.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nationÃ†s most precious resource: your daughter.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
And the ass of the man who adores her.
Will do.
What...
What... are you?
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
My head hurts.
Montana.
Pillow.
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
I hate the environment.
Fragile?
Why the fuck not?
Fuckin' a right.
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
I said -
Dude!
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
About what?
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
To free Terrance and Phillip.
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Chef, do you know anything about women?
What is this?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
That book wasn't Canadian!
No Cheesy Poofs.
No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Is it Cartman's mom?
Very funny!
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
What?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
How the fuck should I know!!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Oh.
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Suck my balls.
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Oh.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Who the hell made up that law?!
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
Hey Cartman.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
And she's getting worse...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
You're late, Cartman!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Your behind?
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
YOU DO?!
Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
What Cartman?!
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
Whoops.
CARTMAN!
No way.
No you can't Kenny!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
AGAGAH!!
Okay.    Not.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Mom...
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Help yourself prickfuck!
Thank God, that sucked ass.
The N word?
Oh yeah.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
I don't know.
What's going on, Chef?
Hey, Chef.
Huh?
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Who are you, kid?
Oh no, it's that kid.
What?
Here I am, Father.
Who to?
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Donkey raping shit eater.
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
Yes I am!
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
My dear President...
My dear...
My President...
My...
My dear...
My dear President...
Is that all?
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
What's that?
MOM!!!
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Who is it?
Guess.
Okay.
SHIT!
Oh my God...
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
That's gonna take a long time!
Dude, we don't have watches.
What's a butfor?
Kay.
Be careful, dude.
His Excellency's car!
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
Kyle, check it out.
That was sweet!
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Yeah!
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
Yeah...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
But you're my father -
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
YOU BASTARD!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
You bastards!!
How can they do this?
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
How do we do that?
I don't know, dude.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
What's the difference?
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
This is sweet!!
Totally!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Yeah, they suck.
Does it say what the clitoris is?
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Okay...
Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris!
Wow!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Yeah, so what do we say?
I thought you had something planned.
Me?!
Oh, brother.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Stan!
Father...
WHAT?
Are you sure, Kenny?
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
Who to?
You're all part of Satan's army now!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
Yes, sir.
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
Oh yeah!
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
It's from your mother.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
You'd fuck your uncle!
Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-
SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
You bet, Terrance!
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
I wanna powder my nose...
Hello, Conan!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Cheers, Terrance!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Don't believe the hype!!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Oh, you are such a maroon!
You would know, dummy.
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
What's going on Terrance?
Canada is saving us!!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
You did? Just now?
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
AGH!
Terrance! NO!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Hey, come here, guy.
Who's my cream puff?
I am.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
You know I do.
What did you do today Satan?
You don't care.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Don't call me dumb!
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
Hey, relax guy!
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-
Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Hey, I'm missing the party!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
All right -
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
WHAT?!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Hi Wendy.
What's the matter, Wendy?
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Wendy?
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't call him, I whistle.
Yankee Poodle.
I don't want him.
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
You didn't?
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
Check.
That was for you.
Oh no, I can't do it.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
No, but I shot some ducks.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
I don't wanna work at all.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
'At's-a fine.
What do I get?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
She did.
You told it to me.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
Send in the next girl.
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
You no gotta no gun.
I can't do it...
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine.  We gotta him.
Sure.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
I can't do it right away.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Excellency, may I present my niece.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
You swine!
You worm!
Bah!!
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
What'll I do with this card?
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Oh, Rufus!
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Now -- er --
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
Why -- why -- of course.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
But -
The king can do no wrong!
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
I didn't come here to be insulted.
This is terrible!
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Oh, would you...?
For you, I would do anything...
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
How you doing, man?
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
Naw, right here's okay.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
How about some ammo?
How much?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
Cal...
Nope.
Then you'll be wet.
I'll be there.
Sure plan to.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.

Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
Who?
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What's it called?
I beg your pardon?
You quit.
Why did you quit?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
It's in your play.
Yes.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
It was either that, or a sardine.
You get what you pay for.

Mmm.

You're still here.
I love your script.
You'd know better'n me.
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  You can go back...
You bet your life.  The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up
Well, first, you got to change the title...
Yes...

But but but but but it's better without...

He doesn't go back to the mill, he gets a second chance to go back to the firehouse...

Then I'll come back, then.

How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  What happened to the horse? She looks at him.  She takes his hand...

Because it's about purity...
That's right...
What?
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
No, that's true.
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Would you like to see it?  I've got the key back at my store...

Maybe they'll be other movies.
Carla was in the car, right?
What are you going to do?
I'll knit you a sweater.
I'm glad you asked...I'll tell you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring business into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, no...
Morning.
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
What I am saying, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
Water or mineral deposits.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
We on for tomorrow night?
After Drama Group.
Drama Group?
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Go you Huskies...
And I might have something important to tell you...
What is it, a surprise?
That's right...
Waal, there you are, and Have I Got Some News for You...
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
What, what what are you doing here?
Yes, that's right.
What are they offering?
Ten thousand dollars.
I beg your pardon?
The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  Although it is altered...
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty million dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Hi!
We had a date.
We did...?
Where have you been...
I've been thinking.
Where have you been, we had a date for three...where have you been...?
Well, I know, because they told me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole town has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a date, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
I wasn't doing business.
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't you, j...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
No.  Don't tell me that.
Why, you whore!
We'll work it out...
Maude, this man wrote this play!
What're you doing here...?
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Whatever it is.  GO do it.  How you doing on the permit?
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And then they kicked us out...
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Try and take it.
You told me that about the last town.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm bleeding...
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  That's where it is...
Now: I'm looking at the...
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
On the coast?  Of course he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the Hague...
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
You know who the father is...?
That Could Be.
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Uh, look....
Then she wasn't in the car.  Say it.
She wasn't in the...
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
And a fantasy object...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
What'll I do for fun?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I know my lines...
Bobby, don't say anything.
Nothing happened.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
No, I was, I was, I was just learning on, it's a...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I loved it...he...
Isn't he...
That makes a lot of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't coming to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you act. What are you doing this evening...?
I'm having dinner with W...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Sister, I've just come from a fire...
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
What do you drink?
How old are you?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Nice town that you've got here.
Are you all right...?
You got to get out of here...
I swear that that woman in my room...
What else?
Page...three.  Now:  It's a nice evening.  I'm not gonna say that... It's a nice...
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion Picture.
The people came to see a motion Picture.  ...hold on...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Tell it with pictures.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
We've got three days to...
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an apron, a brown bag, what is she...? She's a...
She's a waitress.
What...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
You don't need Hi I've just come from the restaurant.
You can go...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
No, you're absolutely r...
And you go start with that stuff in this town...
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
Are you Okay?
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a schoolnight, something...
Everybody needs a hob...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
Joe, the writer?
Just him and me.
We don't show her breasts, we just show your reaction...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
You guys had better leave us a...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Of course he...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
You have to what?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
I've got scene twelve...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
Scene twelve...arrival at the mill.
Aren't you ever in school?
What's his name?
Thank you.
I think he's moved...
Who is it raped you?
Well, what's the beef?
Then what is the...?
We know that you weren't.
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
Who is her agent...?
Get him on the phone.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Get him on the...
I want you to hear this.
Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the wilds sweetheart, you are in error...
You have no right to...
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I love Jewish men.
You know...Where's your bathroom?
I feel so close to you...
I like you, too.
But we...
Who is that...?
I...
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
Claire, when did you...
Claire, Bob Bar...
We're just talking about the...
No, no...Please.
This is Joe White.
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
What, what's there to think about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
How many times in your life do you get a speech like that?
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. Look at the mill
Yes, yes, but...
...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go.
What...?
I can't do it, Walt.
You can't do what?
It isn't right.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
Forget the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
I know that...
Is...Is the Movie!
I know that, Claire.  I, we all know...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...no, they don't...
...they treat me like a child.  I, I...to bare my body.
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
I...I...
...I can't do it, Wally...
Listen to me:  Elanora Duse was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for.  She said, I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week.  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
What?
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
...I...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
...I know...I know...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
Wally...
I know, I know.
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
...yes...
...wants a piece...
Yes.
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am past chagrined, I'm mortified at the way you were spoken to...
I...
An artist of your caliber...
I'm only trying to...
I know what you are, I am so sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
The minute I read that script I said...
I know...
...she works with animals, she...
...yes...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community respects her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, toil...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to us.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's really talk.  We could, we'll have dinner, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Hello.
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Bob are you alright...?
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
That's cor...
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the Nude Scene...? What are we paying her three mil?
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Kiss my ass.
Who got their heads cut?
You said three...?
Main Street.
Fuck the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
I have to talk to you.
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, forget Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to build this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Arrest him.
What is the...?
Arrest him.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
You were in the car with Bob?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
...a history of nothing, he was acquitted...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
He told you that...
He didn't have to tell...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Later for you, pal.
Okay...
Hi.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
I...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could possibly make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
What's in the case?
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
And what was it you wanted to say?
What the hell are you so down about?
How about that.
No.  No, but we're planning to.
Yes.
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
I had a witness I would.
What?
Who's White...?
He saw the accident...?
He saw the girl in the car...
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from Marty.  What's her problem?
That, that's your life's blood on the st...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to double for her, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some pictures of the women's tits.  Of their tits.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
...totally false...totally false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
Not now.
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we booked tonight?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that personal business?  Ah, Christ. Marty...Are we paying you?
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
We're out of money.
I know the feeling.
Grace...
Grace.  Get Mr. White a manual typewriter.  It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
Then, you write that.  And then this is our second chance.  That's why we're here...
I know you do.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some nosh...what do you like to drink...?
Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Where have you been...?
Why?
Get a typist.  Gettim a typist.  Get outta here.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't sure, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll direct the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, literally is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You have to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
I treated you like a son or nephew.
...that's just so narrow...
Then you're finished in show business.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
Siddown!
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you fuck with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your chest.   And the best to Marion...  Where have you been?
He says they're looking for you all day, you're on salary, he needs pages, what are you, you been 'haying?'  Now:
You can't write it?
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
What did you say to them...?
How do you know you saw it?
You didn't see it...
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
It's lovely.
My oh my.
I left that for you.
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
What'd you do, build this...?
How was your flight?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
They're coming Fedex...
What's in all the bags?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
I'm gonna' bring it off.
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a product placement...
Stop...
How are you getting on with these fine people?
Marty...
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the pages for the new Old Mill...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
That's why I want it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
Pay her.
I don't got the money.
Find the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...any time...  What does the woman want from life...?
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
We don't have the money.
Find it.
If you do the product placement...
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, BAZOOMER-COM?
Bazoomer dot com.
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
We got the permit.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
We got to do something nice for him.
She wasn't in...you were al...
There's no witnesses...
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
Yeah?
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can get away, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Wally...?
Mmm.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah...statutory...unsupported testimony by the...  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
Is he cool or angry?
Do something.
I have to tell you, I can not express to you how happy...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Why would they be illegal?
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to bother you with...
...the city council...
...it is?
So we just got lucky.
Givvem a cigarette...
...we can't lose the wind...
Why?
I don't care.  Fix it.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
I killed her!
I don't want to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter how much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
I'd rather be with Mommy.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you are in the purple family.
Never say 'never' -- it's not fair to say 'always' -- and no name calling. Use your words.
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  Terrible name for a planet.
Excellent point.
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
It happens.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Well, not exactly s...
Scream.
How would you know sh...
...why do you think?
So why are you asking me?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Look she's upset --
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
That happens.  To families.
Well.  It's for you.
I hope it's the right kind.
I bet.
Secret's safe with me.
I know how scared I get when you're sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
I can't hear you.
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
And...?
She is but an arriviste.
What's Thursd...
I could help with the debate.
You don't like his friends.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
And what do you do wh...
You have to ignore him.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
Oh, yeh.
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Nothing sweetheart.
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk straight up to that little jerk...
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Let me be the judge of that.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
Good.  That's very good.
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
That's my girl...
There you are!
Annabelle put down that camera.
Put down that goddamn camera!
You know, this horse smells really bad.
...your hating me.
Cos she loves you.  She wanted you to have a daddy to love.  Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
No.
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
No.
But you told us to starve.
Excuse me --
I made you some cocoa.  See?
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
Are you real mad?
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a real one, they do!
Dad!  You can talk him into anything!
IS THAT YOU?
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  Hate.
I have lava.
Queen of diamonds.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Poof!  You're happy now.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
I knew where I was all the time.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Rachel's job is she works.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mommy?
What honey?
If you want me to hate her I will.
Rache says I have to eat lamb.  I told her you're making me spaghetti!
And many meatballs.
Is that like Luigi's?
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Yes.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
That I do.  Always will.
Mom...?
I'm fine, ba...
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Thursday's fine...
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD SUFFOCATE IN THERE!!!
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
No.
Pray.  We never find out.
Mommy's sick, guys.
You have the WORST flu since...
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
Is your bad?
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
No!  I have to get there.
Before you.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Oh.
Okay.  These are good.
I helped.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
Rache can do that part.
Find the bird cage?
Rache says it's from you.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
But you can still see him.
Half.  Of him.
The world.  Thinks I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
So where are you?
Right here.  Right here.  Inside the magician.  Shhhh.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in here.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
It's not good enough.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
So we'll...radiate some more?
That's necessary, huh?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Planning on getting --
Remarried.  There is no move.
Because you don't really seem here.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Something's up wi...
You think I didn't get that?
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Rachel's not half my age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Jackie, they come to be part of my life.  Rachel is part of that life.
Napalm.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
I'm worried.
Me too.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Easy enough.
Good...Well...Take care.
You're WHERE?
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I said I'd get 'em back tonight...
Jackie, we were taking them water- skiing for the whole weekend!
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Not to me.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Called him.  We set an ap...
Don't do this.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for their well-being.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
Slugs.  Have faster learning curves. Trees, even.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
And I'm supposed to care.
Still, please.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
Just not to me.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
To make it easier for them or you?
It's a huge moment in their life --
WE are over.
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
And we all went through that together?
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Yet another spaghetti night.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
We're going to win this.
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
What happens next?
I live or I die.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
A lot smaller.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
We don't have any coffee.
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
What did you do?
...a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item, which her father and I have already told her she is far too young to own.  But you apparently want to buy her forgiveness, with...
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Get out!
You got to hell!
Of all the cheap excuses.  To break a child's heart.
Think twice.  Before you ever pull that again.
I am not here to make it easier for you.  These are my children.  They don't want to be with you.
A court order is gonna say that woman is never alone with my children!  Ever again!  Do you HEAR that?
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
Those are my children you're practicing on.  They deserve first- rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
So why did y...
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
However many.  It's not enough.
Fine, forget it.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
She was angry at herself.
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
I don't know wh...
You WHAT?
Don't flatter yourself.
Nobody likes a snoop.
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
Did I hear the word...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you do get to smoke dope.
How the hell would you know?
How would you know anything?
They came out of my body!
I have given them morelove and more care every fifteen minutes of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty years!
Ironic, huh?
Small world.
You're a cross-dresser.
She hasn't mentioned this.
Moi?
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Oh, my God.
She's devastated.
And you said...?
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
I really look like shit.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the really big issues keep swamping y...
The primo stuff is great for pain.
He's relentless.  A major asshole.
What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
How's she doing with Brad?
It's covered, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
You mean, after I'm dead?
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They need you to be happy.
Feeling the pressure?
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He loves to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Is that what he told you?
Who in the world is he?
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
And I'm going to win.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
You are defending what you did?
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You had her lie about that... that fancy-boy model!
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick loser.  Who didn't care about her pain.
You think I didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think I couldn't figure out some low blows?
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some real growth.
Shut the fuck up.  I didn't go behind your back.
Well, that's what parenting is about, little girl.  They are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell showed her.
And there will come another moment. When the stakes are really there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
Thanks for coming out.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
What's this about?  Because we fought?
No, there isn't.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
He only remembers I found him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Why didn't I?
You'll learn.
I have their past.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
We have to talk.
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
Yeh, it's cheaper.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
I trust you of course I do but --
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Get ready.  To get really mad.
Not yet.
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
And it's my call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Rache, get out of th...
I think so...What do you think?
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Rache, it may take time.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
They're my kids.
She's not gonna die.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
What a great surpri...
Well, they will be.
Why in the world would she t...
I needed some time away.
'...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?
She called it a fight.  The fight.
Can we go sit somewhere?
I told her I loved her.
Restless.
That's not us.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
Where you goin'?
Hey. What's up?
What?
Like what?
Oh.
No prob. I'm cool.
I'll be your guest!
Thank you.
Great to be here.
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Consuelo?
Yes, Mikey?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes.
Really? How many?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
It was God's will.
No.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Must've been hard being poor.
I'm still poor.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
No, Mikey.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
I'm always working.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
This is work.
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
Consuelo. Are you crying?
No.
Speak English.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
You have a bay?
My grandchild-baby.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
He's dead.
Oh. How did it happen?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
How did they execute him?
Poison gas.
Maybe it's for the bestÃ I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongÃ People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
He wasn't.
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
I know!
Why was he on Death Row?
For rape and murder.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
So whaddya think?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do. I love them!
The camerawork's nice.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
This is definitely better.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Yes, I knowÃ But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousÃ But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Nothing, I guessÃ 
OK, you're right, you're rightÃ   You know, we need to screen what we've gotÃ invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesÃ and see what real people think of this.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screeningÃ 
Hip alternative types who will understand the process betterÃ 
We're not ready!
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
What's an audience going to tell you?
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Twinkeys!
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
Was anyone in my room today?
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
I dunno.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Fine.
What's tomorrow?
Huh?
You mean, again?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
What do you want?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.
Your story was terrible!
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
But what kind of pull did you have?
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
I dunno.
Just the same.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Yeah?
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Dad?Ã Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Maybe he's that one in a million!
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
You're welcome.  Dad?Ã Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Hi, Dad!
Gee, you're home early!
Sure, Dad.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Can I join you?
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Thank you for being honest.
Thanks.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Ni...
...gger.
Nigger.
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
No.
I hate reading.
OK.
I dunno...
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Hello, is this Pam?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Oh, I don't remember that...
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Huh. Kids?
How many?
Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
Yeah, sure.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
How'd you get it?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Yeah?
Yeah. I know.
You a pervert?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
What for?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Doubt it.
Whoopee.
So like, yeahÃ I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like Ã still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsÃ Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
So where'd you get in?
Prnceton.
200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingÃ Is the documentary almost finished?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Can I see what you have so far?
SureÃ umÃ yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
What is most important to you?
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
He did?
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! It's my father!
Open up! I know you're in there!
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't know.
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Mn-hm.
Burger Manifesto, Part One is gonna make people think?
Um-hm.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
I don't anymore.
Can I have some?
Knock yourself out.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Did you ever hear that saying, This too shall pass?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Intense.
How long were you in there?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Yeah, I guess.
Mm-hm.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. Oh
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Slides go with it.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Who, Father?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
There IS no one.
It's called Burger Manifesto
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yes.
Typical male.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Uh, home, you know.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
You didn't get me in trouble.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Yeah, when's he coming?
Hey!
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
No I quit.
Hey, you said you did a video?
What's it about?
It's really not about anything.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud.
A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Oh.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Your a nurse?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Any gunshot victims?
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Sounds like a bummer.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Right now?
Yeah.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Now?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Well... where is he?
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
And your mom.
Where are you-hoo?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Shut up! Aw...
Stuck with what guy?
What?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
Yeah.
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
Don't let 'em fight.
The dude wants it.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
That's the rock star thing.
No, no.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Jesus Christ.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
I'd get bored.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
That sounds so depressing.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Ah!
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Watch out for that tree.
A long, long, long, long, while.
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
Okay.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
Go!
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
You're losing your temper!
So you can do an album cover?
Fuck it!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
In the limo!!!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
No.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, I'm not worried.
Good.
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
Yeah.
Uh, last night...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No, no.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
No.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Erica is in the van back there.
What?
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
What she doin' in the van, man?
What?
She's dead.
She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim...
Bullshit.
No, no, no.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
No.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Ah, you know people there?
Jeff! Let's go!
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Yeah.
Come on.
Play it! Come on!
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Come on man.
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Pony? What's a pony? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
So, how was the ride, kids?
Great.
Really?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Hey.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Oh, you were in the band?
Yeah.
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
It's your fantasy...
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
Your his publicist?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Mm. And your like, what else?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Shit.
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
So, then, you're, like, available?
In what way?
Buff.
Buff is funny. God.
Yes! Free concert!
Alright, Pony!
Hey! Hey.
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
You better! Yes!
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
This is private property, my friend.
It's all right! It isn't happening!
But, Father, it IS!
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Please!
It's safe, come on.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
Glad it's okay.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Good. See you later.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: Either the salt is rotten or the meat.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Well, play it, man.
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
I just started it.
Don't drop the guitar, man.
Whoa!
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
You make videos?
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, Closed
Closed, closed, closed. But with your music.
You could do it.
I could.
Yeah!
Yeah.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Yes!
Yeah!
A reel?
You okay, man? You okay?
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
Thanks, man!
I'll be in the car, okay?
I said welcome.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Okay.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
It's nice here. It's different.
Hi.
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. I come from an area. Bel Air.
No, not really. Middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
Yes.
He is.
He is.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
What'd he get you?
A Porsche.
Mm.
Yeah. So, what about you?
What about me? I don't have a car.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Military marching bands.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
I'd like to.
Oh, yeah?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
It's not a job, it's an adventure. Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
What was your name again?
Erica.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Deep down. Way down.
It's a mistake to think that.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
That's what I mean.
I know. It's okay.
Yeah?
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Taking care of business.
I'm sorry.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
We were?
Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Mm.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
I'd love to read that.
Funny shit, man.
Hi.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Um, mother-daughter.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
It does look good.
It's coming along.
Thank you.
Erica, you coming?
Mm-mm.
Please! Please! What are those?
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
Two-fifty.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
He's drunk.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Because I'm alienated.
Who were you talking to?
Nobody. Sooze.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
Sooze wants to see him.
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
What's the matter?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Ask your girlfriend.
See ya later.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. The greatest men are the most alone. And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
Good. That's good.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
No.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
What?
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
What? What'd you do?
That chick, Erica?
Well, w-what happened?
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, Tim
What'd you do?
I hit her.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Oh fuck.
They let you out?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Wow. You did that for me?
Yes.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
I don't know.
You don't know?
No.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
No.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
Just go home, alright?
This is my home.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Will you just put the gun down?
No.
Just put it down.
Jeff, stay there.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
That, that's Indian?
WHY?
Yes.
But surely you know...?
Is that Bee-Bee?
What?
Seven-twenty.
I gave it to you.
Why we're just standing here.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
I don't know.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
That's right.
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Look, why do you care, huh?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
Please?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
You could've come over.
I know, I know, I know.
Oh! Trim it!
I hate that.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
Okay, so maybe later.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
What... you mean got into bed with them?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
It was different...
What was she like?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
I've never LOVED anybody!
I've never been to bed with anybody!
Was that supposed to be me?
No.
Yes.
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Man?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
Your sure as hell right about that.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
The worst I can do is starve to death. Listen to you.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
So you can give me more shit?
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
Yes, you asshole.
About what?
About things that are important to me.
Like what?
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Of course I do!
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
Your completely missing the point.
Hey!
I'm talking about idealism.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
But do you stand for anything?
Yes, I stand for -
What? What do you stand for?
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Typical male.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
This is ridiculous!
Tim!
It was a racial incident.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
It got that close.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
How?
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
Jeff. Jeff.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Sooze.
The fifth one this week!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
And I thought you said it was something special...
What?
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Us.
And?
Come with me.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
So what do you wanna do?
Nothing.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
New ground?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
My goal is to make art.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm-mm.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, no.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
I don't know.
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Mm.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
You do.
No, I don't.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Jeff!
So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
Come on.
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
What?
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
Mm-hm.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Oh, yeah?
I, yeah.
Mm.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
God, you smell like whiskey.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Is that a threat?
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Where are you going?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
To his hotel?
Shit, Jeff!
I've run out of words.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Well, what about us?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, no, no, no.
You're unbelievable.
Oh, fuck it, man!
You're as bad as my father.
'Bye, Jeff.
Go.
What?
Just go.
You really suck, you know that?
Hey, Pony.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Good, man.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
No, it's not...
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah, I crash there.
Yeah, good.
The prom. That's funny.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Sorry.
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
So you think I should?
What?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Now?
Yeah.
Great.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Well, not exactly.
For a while.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
We mustn't let him land!
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
So who are you?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
What?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Of course it does.
You know what I'm saying?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Hey, where's Erica?
I don't know.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Well, what about this?
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
Camel jockey.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Just give me a hand.
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Please. Look...
Look, get down off my property.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Get off my property!
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Look Pakeesa...
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Get off my roof!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
Ready?
What are you saying?
I hope you're happy!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
Pony, oh my god!
Hey!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
Look at you!
Oh!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Oh, yeah?
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Like?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Yeah?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You do not want me to do your cover.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
You're not serious.
I'm always serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Would I get paid?
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah.
And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
Why?
Yeah, come on, play it.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while  Chorus here.  You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be
That was so great!
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Jesus, Jeff.
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
You done?
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
I can't believe you're still here.
I'm moving.
If...
No, I'm going.
Mm-hm.
Soon.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
That's because I am.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Yeah.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Me?
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
You do?
No!
I'll bring it back.
Erik. You don't understand.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
But you don't realize....
Goodbye, Aud...
You know, my mom has this saying.
Yeah?
Really? What else does your mother say?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
I think I gotta go.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Nobody's fucking anybody!
See what's around you listen to their lies
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how
Tim?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Oh, How'd she get back?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
About what?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Whatever.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Don't do that, man, okay?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Yeah.
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
Don't do that.
What are you going to do? Hm?
If you hit me...
Yeah?
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Your manager?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
I'm here.
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Hey, Tim.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
That's right!
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Come on, Jeff.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Jeff!
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Oh that's nice for you.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Could you give me a ride?
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
I'm going out later.
The fuck not?
Fuck.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Well, use your head, Stalker Betty.
You just became a statistic!
Cleo!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
It's twins!!
Wayne Gretzky.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Of course.
Do you believe I love you?
I... but I...
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Yes -- I believe you do.
Then let go!
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Hello?
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Diane?  Diane!
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
No...I've been pregnant.
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
You sure?
Positive.
Positive you're sure I'm not fat or positive I'm...
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a pregnancy insanity.  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, Dreams can come true.  Right?
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
And they get caught!
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
The second note.
The second note to wake the Gods...
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
... I don't know.  Probably not.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Well...
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
we practice!Sorry; Cleo.
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to fuck me up!  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to fuck me up?
She thinks you went to the police.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Hi, Jack.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Spit from your dad?
Yeah.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty stinky - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Y'think?
I sure do.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, Tricks are for kids!  And you think, I'm a kid
Jack...
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Trix...
Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!
Jack, I think I should get a job.
I know, but that was before.
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
Not quite...
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
Mmm-hmmm...
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
...so although their dad said, Don't get out of the car until I get back with help
That was gas, Sweetie.
Oh... What are you working on?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Well, I want to know what happened --
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
I'll just ask the question myself... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
We're here for you, Diane.
Hat-trick?
He is the Great One...
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
No you're not sure or No I'm not fat?
Uh, no... You're not fat.
You sure I'm not fat?
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...
Shut up.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Kansas!
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
We were told you could fix us up.
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Oh no...
He Ikea'd us.
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
That you?
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Don't use big bills!
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Then I shall come too.
No... no...
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
Yeah?
Hello?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
Ammo?
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
You're kidding.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself with child
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
Ooops, hold on a sec.
Hold on...
Screw Lucy!
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Thanks!  That'd be great.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
I'll get them before Touched by an Angel
Definitely old.
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with at church camp ain't leading to the big O.
But --
It was my master Keitel's idea.
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
You sure you wanna go there?
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say Fat-assed lesbian!
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
All of you!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
They could kill you.
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Your help.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
My best friend got pregnant.
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, P.S. My mom's a dyke too?
Hey, don't mouthy shit me - I'm outta here.
What d'you mean?
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
More proof God's a guy...
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
How do we know this is the way?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
I shouldn't have come.
I see the world.
It is day, of course, Freya.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
Is there nothing men can do?
I will go and wake them up!
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
No... we don't...
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
Well... isn't it great?
Would you like us to sing to you?
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
A lot of people like our singing.
But you don't want to hear it.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
You're just saying that.
REALLY?
Really.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
No.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM
We're just not a very musical nation...
No.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
Well, how d'you think I feel?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
I'll tell you what...
Yes?
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
You've got to let me go!
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
They'll be more than hurt if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Why?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
But it IS! Look!
The important thing is not to panic.
Have you done this sort of thing before?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
What about the raping?
Shut up.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
What?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Well you started it.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
Oh, thanks.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
I didn't mean to!
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
Tell me your name?
Buddy, are we in trouble.
What a stupid idea.
Why?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
There's no vodka in it.
What? What did you tell me?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Brad Wilson.
I seem to be.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You look wonderful.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
You're welcome...??
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
It sure is.
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
You know what's the problem?
Too much mayonnaise?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
I didn't --
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
But Lana, you could --
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
Who?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
You thought that?
I thought Clark Kent has a really nice voice. You didn't even know I was there.
I just can't stand this.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
I mean him.
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Me??
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
There's a lot of choices here.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Peanut butter and jelly.
No, thanks.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
Me neither...
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
I can never get a way from it.
Old ties are hard to cut.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Can I help?
He really was!
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Why should you care?
I don't know! I just did!
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Anyday...
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Oh. You're going away.
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Well...  Not quite like this.
What!
We get together sometimes.
Find it... AND cross it!
Sure.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
Mmmmm . . .
What's that?
At one o'clock in the morning?
What are you doing?
Gus Gorman.
What?
Yeah.
Kitchen. . . Technician
Nope, but --
Thirty-five.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
What about this week's check?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
Who gets it, the company?
So where is all them half-centses?
One.  And a half.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- dig where you're comin' from.  You want to be rich, right?
Uh...
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
He was lucky...  Sit there.
I'm tryin' to.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
I don't think you understand.
Man, what is this?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Decaffeinated too?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee.
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail.  And you are going to do it for me.
Me? How?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
That what they call you?
How do you do that?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
When?
First question got to be Where.
What?
Not What. Don't need a genius to figure out what. Need a genius to figure out where.  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Come on, move it!
Just the man I wanted to see!
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
What are you talking about, fella?
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
God, that's what I keep you for.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
KRYPTONITE!
Huh?
They ain't got captains?
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Now...when do I get a taste?
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Is this blackmail?
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
What do you want?
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
For what?
A computer.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
You designed it?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
What will it do?
Everything.
What will it get me?
Tell me more...
Yeah? How's it look?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking get-down hot-cha daddy-o whatever you called it.
Stone mutha.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Can you do that?
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
Watch out for them air pockets!
We back in Metropolis?
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Sister! I'm his sister!
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
What she call you?
And do what?
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
Thank ...you.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
How deep IS the ocean?
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
No.
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
Energy! And when they say Energy what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.
How would you know?
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining. ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
Turn on the light.
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Superman. The boy you left behind.
What's wrong with making friends?
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
I can't! It's out of control!
Missing????
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
It could make weather!
Storms! Floods!
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
She's not his mama either.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Today coffee----
TOMORROW THE OIL!
I know!
Small potatoes.
We already have a super-tanker.
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
What's wrong?
Where did it come from?
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
A normal person.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
We can get to work on that oil!
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Who needs Gus?
He's the only one who can operate this --
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Don't bet on it!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
Yes! This time we got it right!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
I met this girl...
She got me thinking...
I... I... KILLED her...
Well, you ARE!
Row! Row! Row!
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Faster!
You may need a real Berserk.
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
SHUT UP!
ROW!
Look, the sky is blue...
It's magic.
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
What magic have you brought, Erik?
You'll see!
What did he say?
Look out!
What about him?
You wanna go out with him?
You must help us.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
That's better.
Row!
To the oars!
No! Let go, Snorri!
You'll be sucked down too!
There is another way.
Nobody gets killed.
Oh... er... yes...
What's the matter with them?
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Wait, Erik!
Keitel Blacksmith?
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
But how could he know... unless...
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
But...
Well, what else do we do?
How about making friends?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!
What is it?
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
What are you talking about?
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
I will join my grandfather there.
What are you talking about, Erik?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
We'd be the first!
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
I was sitting there.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
I AM one, Dad!
She hasn't got any.
She MUST have a knife or something...
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Sven!
Let me do something for myself for a change!
I came to find my grandfather.
I have to go...
The Dragon...
Do what?
He hasn't.
Aaagh!
Got you!
Let me go, Sven.
What are you talking about?
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Hang on...
I... I...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
Get away, Snorri.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
You could charge him what you like.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Yes yes... of course.... the Blacksmith's Code...
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
Can't make enough swords!
Can't make enough axe-heads!
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
That's right.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Well... I... I thought...
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
How can we stops him now?
Sh! Hurry!
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
Relax!
Help!
You'll drown us bo...
Help!
Help!
Shut up!
She knows it was our fault!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
You've lost your mind.
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
You fool!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
I know, Dad.
You went berserk...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did your father...
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
KILL! KILL!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Well, of course he is!
Sh!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Helpless...
He drove me mad!
Easy, Dad!
You liar!
Neither am I.
Shut up.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
Tell him I'm coming!
What makes you think he'll do it?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
I thought you hated those people.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
What's up?
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
There won't be any need for that sir.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
It's Esther.
What do you want me to do?
Please, call me Mordechai.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
Any sign of Santa?
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
C'mon follow me.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Want to get a drink?
I said, do you come here often!?
What!?
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
Yes Esther.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Oh. Okay.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Keep going.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
We do!
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
What are you doing here?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Esther!
Esther!
Mordechai!
We go to the same temple.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
So don't show a picture.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Mom! We're eating!
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Okay, what's the information?
Anything else?
But we're not open on Sundays.
I'll be in my office.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
What's wrong with him?
He's still working out some identity issues.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Oh yeah. Take a look.
What are you doing?
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
A stereo type alarm system?
How do we bypass it?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
What are you doing?
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What are you doing?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
You're late.  Where you been?
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
All of it.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
I think it's the best...
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
What?
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
I'm out, Johnny.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.
Then why ain't he dead?
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
There's always a depression on.
I like griftin'.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I'm busy, Floyd.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Mottola.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
They workin' for anybody?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
What about the other one?
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Hackers.
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
Good lad.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
What do ya want the others to get?
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
You sober?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You mean you blew it.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I picked something up on the way.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You never do, kid.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You know anything about him?
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
Why?
'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
I never played for winos.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
Then you'll do it?
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
Neither are we.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
Let him wait.
Save your breath for the climb.
You just worry about your end, kid.
If we ever get to it.
How'd ya do?
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Everything go all right?
Yeh, it was easy.
No signs of trouble?
What do ya mean?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
No, not a thing.
How 'bout Lonnegan?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
Did he hold you up on anything?
You think he'll show?
Did he say he wouldn't?
No.
He'll show.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
I thought I'd lost him.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
But I don't know how to polka.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business.  'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game.  Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.
Then why you doin' it?
Henry.
Yeh.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
You beat him, kid.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
You wanta wait for your share?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
I also gotta win.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
What was that?
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Nice work, J.J.
That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
How ya doin'?
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Lonnegan.
See ya and raise three.
Five and call.
Pass.
Raise 1,000.
Raise 500.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
Siwash, huh?
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
See and raise 1,000.
Raise 5,000.
I guess I left it in my room.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
What are the odds on Syphon?
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
You're more gutless than I thought.
She coulda killed me last night.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
My end was only one.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Think nothin' of it.
You done?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
It isn't any better.
Where's June today?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
Sixty-five.
2:00 A.M.
Yeh, sleepin'.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
No.
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
What the hell for?
He'd like to kill me.
Looks like he missed ya.
Yeh, this time anyway.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
You move right along, don't ya.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
I don't even know you.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled Indians through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that Indians misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
He cheats.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
Yeh, he knows that.
What do you mean?
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
So could Shaw.
Then why the rat?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
All right, then.
What do you believe in then?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
Maybe a couple million.
You're dreamin', kid.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Get on with it then.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
And you were gonna pay me back?
I am after this race.
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
Why don't ya then.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got a system, Carver?
You stayin' in or not?
I'm in.
It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.
You got the 400 grand yet?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
Let me talk to him.
No.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
What happened to your face?
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
Is everything getting worse?
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
He's right, Les.
What happened?
Oh, Jesus.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
I don't know, figure something out.
No.
Don't think I know him.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
No.
I'll make parole.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
You mean she's dead?
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
You weren't hired to miss him.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
No.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
Just a minute...
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
Said he stole his invention.
What?
You got him involved?
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
And if it isn't?
Oh, Andy.
I can't.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
And don't ever try to see me again.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Go away!
Oh, Andy, Andy!
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
Give it to me.
Oh, here she is.
What is it? Has he found him?
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
What is it?
Nothing.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
No.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
That's your problem.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Shush!
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
I didn't.
Then what are you hiding?
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
There!
Now do you believe me!
Mother!
And I'll give then proof!
He's waiting for you.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Another Martini --
Hello, there!
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Yes.
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
I'm staying with the Countess.
I don't.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
Not that scrawny little....?
How did you ever remember me?
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Probably not.
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Disappeared!
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Macaulay.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
Why don't you try him again?
Your father?
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Oh, thank heaven.
Come on in.
I've got to see you alone!
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.
There.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Where did you hit her?
Why... in the heart.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
She fell down.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
I don't know.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
That's the truth.
Hello, Dorothy.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder -
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Dead?
It's been the same one for three months.
Forgive me.  How are you?
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
Yes, she would.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
What would your mother say to that?
This is my wedding.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
Where are you going?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
A new invention?
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
It's a promise?
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
He's all right.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
I know -- I know --
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
And he still wants to marry me!
He's a brave man.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
I'm very interested in that body.
Where are the others?
Shrapnel!
Yes... yes.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
That woman!
Not a thing.
Gilbert!
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
How'd you people happen to pop in?
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
We were looking for this bird.
I never saw him before.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Nothing.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Keep on asking.
Not without a warrant.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
Have you got a pistol permit?
No.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
This gun yours?
No.
Who's is it?
I'll have to try to remember.
Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.
You mean about that gun?
That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
Man to man, I'm not.
So would I.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
What about the suicide?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
You've been there?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
No proof?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Who's your candidate?
What about Jorgensen?
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
What about this Nunheim?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
He's holding out on you.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
Well, what'd you think?
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Nunheim!
Get anything?
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichÃšs and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
This is enough for me.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
D.W.R.  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Rosebreen.
Could this be him?
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
I'll take care of him.
Are you kidding?
No.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
You mean that body-----?
--was Wynant's.
Shut up.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well, what?
He did!
When was that?
Did you go?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
Tell me about it.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
There are a few things we want to check up on.
I see.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
No.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You did!
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Tell 'em.
That's ridiculous.
Let him have his say out.
Good morning --
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
But he's interested!
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
You're political, then?
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Want to take a poke at him?
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
Where were you?
Where were you?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I'll get some.
I know.
Chris!
I couldn't go near that woman.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Chris -- Chris -- !
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
We're just having a little drink.
So I see.
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
Who's that man?
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
I don't like him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
What bonds?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Don't you remember....
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
That's my business.
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Go ahead!
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Oh, he's sitting up.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Oh, please, Nick.
Did you get my money?
I'm not telling anyone.
That's just why I'm going.
Never mind.
I trust you.
No.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. NiwetÂ³kame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
What is Debbie's position?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Thanks, and goodbye.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
No.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
No word at all?
My wife.
S'long.
How are you?
Slim.
It might.
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
That's Jellybean!
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Hello, Mimi.
want to talk to you about something very important.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
What do you think?
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Well, don't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Yes...
Where's Gilbert?
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
They'll want more than your word for that.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
Perfectly absurd.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
I've never heard about you.
Why tell me?
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
What's that?
This is your party.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
So it's you he was after!
Hello, baby.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I had him out this morning.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
Oh, this is Andy --
You might have mentioned me first.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
No, I guess not.
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
Pretty girl.
If you like 'em like that.
You got types?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Who is she?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
That last Martini.
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Take it easy.
Who's that?
Santa Claus.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
We need ice.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Room service, please -
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
What are you drinking?
Rye.
Where did you get that?
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
She didn't tell me a thing.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Yes.
Good. I want to talk to you.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Can't you get to sleep?
No.
No thanks.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
I'd like to see you work.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
But it's Christmas now.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Someone get a doctor.
There's one coming.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Want a drink?
Yeah.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
You're a fine watch dog.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Well, didn't you?
I never saw that before.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
You did.
You must admit I have good taste.
Finished with these?
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Hello... send him up.
Macaulay.
Aren't you hot in that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?
Yes.
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Sit down!
You talk as if I were Asta.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
What's the matter with you?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
So am I.
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
Like what?
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Looks like a hold-up!
What are you going to do?
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You bet I wouldn't.
Not with all your money!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Sure I will.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
Back to California
What do you mean?
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
What things made you so sure?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Well, don't they?
Sure.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
How long has he been dead?
Couple of months anyway.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Smart gal.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
No.  Nobody but you.
I'm going to tell her.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
Who do you think did it?
Mimi...
Mimi!
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me who.
I wish you'd tell me.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
What do you think?
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Whose fault was that?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
You're going to drive me crazy!
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
Is that true?
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
How did you get in here?
You worked here?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
Yes.  Nick!
Yes.
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
I know I left them there.
Maybe she has.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
I'm cold.
Where are you going?
Home?
Who fired you?
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Paper.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I have to go, Julian.
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
Oh, God.
What?
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
No, please, not again.
They stopped.
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
What are you doing.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Going north?
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
What kind of mine?
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
For climbing.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
Yeah.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
We can't just go off and--
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Where'd they go?
Weird they didn't chase us.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Missile!
What am I supposed to do?
Epps!
Ready when you are.
Yep.
I'm the best.
What about the gold?
Maybe we should split it up now.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You're the one with all the ideas.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
He...he could have been watching us.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
Tired...
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
A born freak can only go uphill.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know he isn't.
He's an enemy soldier.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
Then step aside.
Get out of my way.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
What if I do?
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
Bonanza Jellybean?
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
I have to answer him.
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Give it to me!
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
Your ranch?
Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
A job for me?
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
I thought it would be good to know.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Now you need me.
He says it's a box.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
You get it yet?
You will.  You'll get it.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Jaeger?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
That's in two days.
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
Jaeger?
You ever think about dying?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
What?
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Oh, no.
If!  If there's a treasure.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
If there's gold.  If!
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Oh, Jesus!
We got to get out of here.
We have to go back.
We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
Then lets go back while we still can.
Really?  What is that, an order, private?
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
You want to crawl, crawl.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
Is there anything you do know?
We have to do something.
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
What do you think?
It's got a bottom.
You down?
What do you see?
What the hell are you doing!?
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
You want to say some words?
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
Very well, Jacques.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
Where did you find it?
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
No!
Eleven o'clock!
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.
No.
No ...  Have you ever been in Vienna?
Amsterdam?
Constantinople?
But you have been in Venice?
Let me tell you, Venice can't compare with Constantinople.
I don't care what you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I don't want to see you at all!
Thank you.
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
You can trust me.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I hope you find the figures correct.
I hope so, too.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of this report.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Are you insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
No, not at all!
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I don't know, M'sieu Giron!
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
But not now.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
No, to you--M'sieu Monescu.
Yes, m'sieu.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Very well, m'sieu.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
What do you mean?
You say I am a crook.
I know it!
M'sieu ...
Monescu.
Just call me Gaston.
Thank you, Major.
Good day, Major.
Who?
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
Do you know King Boris?
No--no.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
I would like to.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And she will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Why should you?
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Thank you!
Disappointed?
No--proud. Very proud!
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head.
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Please.
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
I like you, Baron.
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Thank you, Baron.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
What time is it?
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out with the Bank of Constantinople?
Gaston!
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Last year? It can't be that long.
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Right.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
We'll take the Royal Suite!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Darling!
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
And her jewelry is worth a fortune!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
What?
But it's not enough!
This woman has more than jewelry.
Ah!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Oh, no, darling. There's more sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
Filiba ...
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Yes!  Now don't worry!
â•”ysÃše seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you.
Spanish passports?
Correct. Now the train leaves--
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is DoÂ±a Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late!
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
By the way, how is your German?
Grossartig--kolossal!
Also, um zwoelf Uhr.
Am Berliner Zug.
Auf wiedersehn.
What time is your rendezvous?
Yes, M'sieu Colet?
You have to get out of here!
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Don't you realize--
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
But, Lily--
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
And you--
Lily--
Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her.  Well--  she's worth it! [ You were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a handbag. You can pay a hundred thousand for him!]
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company!
Yes...?
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Yes.
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Yes.
Yes.
I know that niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
I remember.
You like that statue?
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
The pleasure is mine, madame.
One purse--  empty. One vanity case--
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Oh! You didn't read it!
Naturally I did.
Oh!
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and should, get love letters.
M'sieu Laval!
Too much blue in crimson.
That's what you need!
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
What shade of powder do you use?
That's too dark.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately.
Do you know my first name?
No. What is it? Tell me.
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
What?
As you like.
Eighteenth century.
Yes!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Right!
Beautiful specimen.
It is beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Oh?
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame--
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at home?
You think that's too much?
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
It's disgraceful!
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Ye-es?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
What would you do if you were my secretary?
The same thing.
You're hired!
I'll be delighted.
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Yes, madame?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Um-hum ...
Then riding together.
Um-hum ...
Then lunch in the Bois--
Together.
Then a little nap--
How do you like my dress?
Beautiful.
Marvelous.
Lipstick?
Crimson!
Correct!  Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Goodbye.
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
No--yours, madame.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
But incidentally, let me tell you, I don't like you. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin your reputation--like that!
Yes, I would!
Like that?
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
Shut up--kiss me!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments!
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've got to stay. You can't go now!
I must go.
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
I love you.
I believe you.
Then why do you want to go?
Because I want to make it tough for you.
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
On the night table.
But I don't want to be a lady.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Please!
Thirty-three--
No--thirty-five!
Yes, Gaston?
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Call the police?
Instantly.
Um-hum ...
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
You look beautiful.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Adolph?
And you expect me to believe that?
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
I don't believe it!
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!
Goodbye...
Divine ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
But it could have been glorious.
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Goodbye ...
To M'sieu Laval?
I know!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Jacques!
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
Please!  Thank you.
Yes, madame?
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Naturally not!
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
No, he works too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
For all the really important things--
Right!
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. Five o'clock--remember!
Very well, madame. Thank you.
How much is your salary?
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words!
I think you'd better go.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I beg your pardon!
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
But you're the more intelligent one.
Yes, my bag!
But you saw it here.
Well, where is it?
Anya!
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
It would be a nice change from you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
You're a charming liar. You know, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
How'd you ever get away with it?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
I never want to go back....
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
Hope we're not intruding.
This is Miss Marsh.
Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
Well--shall we go into dinner?
I'll join you later.
And do bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
And I can Tell you Where to get off.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Will you leave me alone?
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Baloney!
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
Feeling a little better, I see.
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
Glad to see you again.
I hope so.
That's a date.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
We'll save you a place at our table.
Thanks.
Isn't she lovely?
Yes--and very popular--
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast why you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
I think you do.
Montana?
Isn't that interesting?
You'll excuse me.
Gladly.
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
No!--Did you take that bracelet?
Where'd you get it?
What did you want a gun for?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Aces full.
And me coming in with two pair--
You're coming back--
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Could I see you a minute?
Sure!  Excuse me.
No gentleman would do that.
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
Oh, no--I played with your cards--in your cabin--at your suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I'm so sorry!
Want to take it back?
I thought you were one of my friends.
I'd like to be.  Sailing on the Progress?
Yes--are you?
I'll say she is!
Nice lines--
Yes--
Like her paint job?
Very much--
You've got lipstick all over you.
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
So you washed it off!
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by.
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Good-by!
There's soft music--
sorrygot an appointment to play shuffle board.
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
You work too fast for me, young man.
Never eat before the show.
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
This is Mr.--er--
Brett is the name.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
You know, you're not a bad-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Married?
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Tell me.
Isn't she attractive?
Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.
Don't rub it in.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
When?
At seven-thirty?
Okay.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
I'll be there--Good-by.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
Sorry.
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
What are you thinking?
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
But--
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Sally--!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You mean that?
Don't let's talk about it.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Lonesome?
We'll let it go at that--
What, again?
What?--
I didn't know we were going to be married.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
I think we ought to walk.
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
I could see you were pining away--
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Yes--I remember--
How well do you know her?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Who with?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?--I won a little--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
What do you know about them?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can live that down, can't you?
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Come on--let's take a swim.
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Make it five.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
I'll be waiting on deck.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Jimmy!
Well, I'll be--!!!
What's the matter?
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
I thought you were a smart guy.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Nix, the law!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
How're the tips?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list.
Why didn't I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Inspector McKinney.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
I'll take one.
What is it?
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it--
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Where did you hide it?
Get it!
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
Three Jacks.
It's a pleasure.
Much better--thank you--
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
Think again--
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
I'll go with you--
Care to join us?
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
I wouldn't be surprised--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Good night!
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?
How about you?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Why?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Sure, I'll go.
I'll go with you.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--here--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you--
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Why, I--
Thanks. That makes us square.
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
I should say not.
Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
She did?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
What's that?
If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard--
What'll I say?
How?
In New York.
Sure.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Back is in New York.
Sure.
Send that.
Next month is June.
June? That's my wife's name.
Sure.
Well. I'd rather see you get it than the company.
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
What?
Knots!
Not the real Chad Denby?--
Yes--Me--in person!
So what?
Nuts to you too!
Hello, Denby!
I thought I put you to bed.
Well, did you find me?
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
She's in New York.
That's fine.
Who won?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
I was never stiffer in my life.
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
Denby!--Are you Chad Denby?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
McKinney's the name.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it-
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Yeah--
I didn't--
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Is this your gun?
Yes!
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Are you happy?
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here.
Everything O.K.?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Like it?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all Nice people--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
No--not much--excepting--
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
Do what--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
I'll never love anybody else.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up right guys?
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
He does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Yes.
Very serious?
Very--
Why--don't you like him?
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
What do you mean?
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Meaning what?
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Well, let's hear the poem--
Very good, Mary--
What's the matter, Mary?
H'mm--Dear Atlantic--
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
All right. When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
So what?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
No--He's probably one of the Here's How.  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Good-night, folks.
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--Gee you're tight.-- and the window says--You loosen up a bit and so will I.--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
What happened to you?
What for?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
He works the boats as a come-on man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
Can you read 'em Jack?
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
How much did you lose?
I went for four.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
I wish I could.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
You get wise to yourself! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
--you'd go with him!
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Not because of Ned.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
You can't bluff me any more.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
Not a chance--I'm through.
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Why?
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
Congratulations.
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Say, Thanks very much!
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
That's the truth--every single word!
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you did--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
Thank you.
It all depends on what you're used to.
Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
I'm all right.
I'll explain later--
Wow!  Cool!
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Yeah!
Okay.
Oh, yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
Just one?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
But Mom, I can't find him!
Okay...
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Can I help pump the gas?
Yeah?!
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Right here in the van.
But what if we leave them behind?
Hey!  Wow!
Here!  In the car!
Which one can I open first?
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
We're almost there.
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Hello-o-o...
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Watch yourself!!
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Yes, I can.
You can't!
Can!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Where?
What's going on?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
That's why.  Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
THAT is Sid!
You mean that happy child?
I could have stopped him.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Trouble?!  Where?!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
No.
According to my nava-computer, the --
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
Go away.
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Alright Buzz, get ready...
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
Shield your eyes!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Woody, stop it!!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Don't tell me what to do!
Shhh!
What happened to you?
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Come on, this way!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Yeah, right.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Yes Sir!
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Shhhhhhh!
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Woody!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Great!
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Hold still, Buzz!
Ha-ha!!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Not today!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Stay calm, everyone!!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Hi!
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
A lunchbox?!
Alright!  That's it!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
No!  No, no, no, no!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
No, no, no, wait!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
I was close to being scared that time.
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Okay, save your batteries!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Last present!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Uh-oh.
Sid!!!
Reach for the sky!!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
That's right.  Your toys.
Hey, Slinky?
No, Slink --
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Speed up!
Slink!  Hang on!
Number one.  She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Dead at forty-one.
He's pretty!
Okay!  I wasn't sure
The stripper's here.
Excellent.
She's fucking hot!
I need a drink.
Jesus.
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
That's a horrible ugly comment. Dead whore? She's a person!
Can't do what?
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
What did you say?
I didn't hear you.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Sorry Fish.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
You're an asshole.
Multiple reasons.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
Playing?
Why was the floor wet?
Why?!
It's sacrilegious.
This is pathetic.
What did you say?
Don't point at me.
I have plenty of friends.
The hell I don't.
What are you fucking talking about?
And you're a little fucking reject.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You fucking bastard!
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
You want to hear me out?
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
She's got no fucking pulse.
You don't know what you're doing.
Wait!
What?
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Calling the ambulance.
Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
We have to call the ambulance.
Why?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
Are you sure this was an accident?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
That is not an option. There is no multiple choice here.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
Stop it!
There's more.
Just giving the facts.
I'm calling the police.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Bury her out in the desert.
Sure, why not.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
Her fucking head was caved in.
So I didn't fucking do it!
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What about the blood?
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
Sun rises at 5:52.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
What?
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
So that's what we're doing.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
Alright. Let's do it.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
You got us into this mess.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Don't talk to me about character.
Watch the tone fella.
Fuck you Boyd!
Any time fat boy!
What is your problem?
I can't do this.
What?
At the seven-eleven.
Who? What are you talking about?
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
I don't give a damn.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
Adam! Calm down.
It has worked.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
I got children. I've got a life.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
What?
Later.
There is no candy!
We'll be ready Adam.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Are you solid with that?
No. I think it's fucked.
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
Don't ever stare him down.
I won't do it.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
I know and I'm honored...
I know...
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
What happened? Oh my God...
No way.
It has to be done.
I want you to hear me out.
What.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
I don't think so.
Have you thought about what I said?
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
I got you.
Where's the bathroom?
What are you talking about?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
What is it?
What?
She's not here.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Who?
Yup.
That's right.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
She's in there!
No I don't.
Fish?
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
I don't think so Boyd.
But not tonight.
Not tonight.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
Left side.
He's right.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
I got her arm.
Here's his head.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?
I'm not talking to you?
What is her disposition?
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
You said that Boyd.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Who's up for making some real money?
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
We need padded chairs.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
I can't.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
No.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Call 911.
Shut up.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Nobody knows.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
Good God...Good God...
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
I'm calling the police.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
What kind of words?
I'm talking about prayer.
Go ahead.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
It goes; Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
You always were a jealous man.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's having a problem here.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
He's cracked up.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What?
I said, what have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
What's your point?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
Suck my ass.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Just do it.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
What does that mean?
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I don't know...
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
What does that mean?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Yeah.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Hear what?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
That's right.
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Okay fine.
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
Not a prayer.
You need help.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
The hell I did!
I don't hate women.
False.
Not true.
New king.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
Then what do they have?
There's my point exactly.
Take Mexico.
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Easy Micheal.
We're not goosed.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Stop it!
Stop.
Give me the Valium.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
Are we supposed to?
What?
I do.
Government cutbacks.
We missed the deadline.
I don't think so.
I'm not sure.
I think so.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Sent it.
Yes.
I think I forgot the tent.
I think so.
Why what?
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
How could I know what else I forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Are we going to do this again?
I wouldn't know.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
How do you figure?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
What are you talking about?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's quiet.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
He's a great chef.
You expect more what?
That's absurd.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
You will not be common!!!
Of course.
With all my heart.
Problems?
Okay.
I'm not. What's the problem?
What kind of seats can we have?
So what do we do?
Go down where?
I'll call them from the road.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
I will.
Of course.
I love you.
Hi.
Not yet.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Hey. It's me.
No. Just like an hour or so.
Okay.
What!
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
I'm working on it.
Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
This is our honeymoon.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Yeah. Sure.
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Can we just talk this out?
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
I know.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Okay. Okay.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Yes.
No it's not okay. It's not.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
The prostitute.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
Micheal, by accident.
It's too late.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
But...
But...
What money?
He kept saying he was protected.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
So what do we do?
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
What?
No...
You did all right dad.
Harry Chaplin. Cats in the Cradle.
I love you dad.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
What does that mean?
I'm not breathing right.
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
He's your brother.
I'm getting married...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Where did you get that?
Buzzing?
The wahoo?
The wahoo moment?
I think so.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
No...No.
How do you know she's dead.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
I got to agree with that.
The first day.
What?
Did she believe you?
I have no idea.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
Greenpeace.
Greenpeace?
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
Where's Boyd?
Downstairs in the closet.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading Atlas Shrugged
Did he try to kiss you?
All week long.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - Pup Corn.
Pup corn?
That's right, Pup Corn. Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of Pup Corn pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes Shelmer
Yeah?
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
That's a good one.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
That's what I'm thinking.
Good times.
She's dead.
Fucking desert.
That's right.
Shut up Micheal.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
Lure him.
Well, darlin' I ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  Now:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
Hello.  What?
Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent.  We bring'em back tomorrow, the charts go up, they don't go down...
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's cost effective.  This is....
No, this is great.
Ames here.  Yessir...
The thinking is, as of this moment, Terrorism...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the Albania thing...
...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
...and he's got a negative rating of...
NY Times, Washington Post, War, War, War.  Times got the girlscout page twelve, Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...?
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
What can it hurt.
Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of paper...
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her chart?  Because...
A small, calico kitten, sir.  Calico.
A new take on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
...this is a snappy song....
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
It's the gratitude of your party, and of your President...
Indeed it is.
...The Albanian Campaign...
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  I have here
Much more...uh, he have much more time to serve?
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you mean and...?
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Well, get on the phone, and get it...
Oh, Lord....
...where?
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  You knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
...the Harvester...
He's dead.  He's dead.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe.
Who we got here...?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you do here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Who's got the story?
Don't you want to know if it's true?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a story, and, it breaks they're gonna have to run with it -- How long've we got til it breaks?
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  Okay:  Okay.  We'll set up the War Room Here...
When do we bring'em back?
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out now.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
It won't hold.
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane right now to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the Boeing people.
Do it...
And you?
It won't hold.
What would do that...?
I'm working on it.
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
What is it?
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
I'll see you at National.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
Tell me again.
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the appearance of a war.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the appearance of a war.
But, but, but, they would find out.
...the...
The American people?
Yes
...but...
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of Legos.
...you want us to go to War...
...that's the general idea.
Why?
Why not, what've they ever done for us...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber...
...they sound what?
Shifty.  Who knows anything about em...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be quick, it's gotta be dramatic, you got to have an enemy.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Well, I'm working on it....
Yes.
Why?
What do you know about them?
...nothing...
Precisely.
What did Albania ever do to us?
What did they ever do for us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There is no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.
...where is the Back End coming from?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
In the yellow ribbon.
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from that...
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
...can we see the Kitten...?
Hello... Yes.  We'll be back...?
We'll be back tonight.
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Waal, that's where you want em...
...I just hope...
Why is this putz on the air...
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
...take a long view.
...what's the Long View?
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Wilfred.  We've got work to do...
Eight Days To Go
I live for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
Big Bird touches down when?
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Press thought no
I think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
An Albanian, a young Albanian Girl.
No rain.
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some Harvest Festival, something...
Get on this, right now...
...got to be something.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
...this's good...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Yes:  she is saying this in Albanian, but she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
Our adopted land...
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
...uh huh...
Now, the Old Lady starts to Weep, Big Bird shrugs off his secret Service, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Find out is there any chance we can get some rain tomorrow, will you...?
So forth...
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Knock on wood.
I dunno.... Ambassador to Togo, somethin', I dunno... he...
Maybe he's just a patriot.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
Due in Nashville.
Nashville...?
You're tired, Ronnie.
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does Moss want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the file, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
...this is magnificent.
8 days and we bring it back home....
None of these are ours.  None of em are ours....  ....that's real politik, Buddy.
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
...I just missed my plane.
You missed your plane?  My life is over.  My life is over.  What have you done to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
Well, keep your wits about you, and let's see if we can't...
...fourteen years...
...brazen-it-through...
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... how long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to hand it to you.  They sure let us out of there easy....
...they just hadn't thought it through...
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
The War is Over.
Oh, God...
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
Oh, Lord....
...those limp-dick ... turncoat... I thought they let us out of there too easy.....
War's over, Pal.
Gloria -- sell the House.
He thinks it's too...
How's your wife?
Fine.
Pride of a job-well-done...
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's more than that.
That's not bad at all.
Well, you know, The Whole Thing's Theatre...
Napoleon said, fellow won't sell you his life, but he will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.
Uh...Didn't we do this?
Wilfred.
...what have you done to me...
...what are we going to do...?
Give'em another pill...
Hello?   No, operator...
Courage, Mom.
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do now? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, Whaleshit, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict shithead? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... shithead....?
How do we explain that?
What about him?
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
Stanley, you can't do this....
Could we have you in here, please...7
Oh, MiGod.
I'd like to mention a few names, who...
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose employ...
And I take this opportunity to suggest that, equally, I admit to nothing, and that I would like my lawyer present.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
Any untoward revelation regarding, uh...
...what is this?
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
We're locked into Albania.
Hello...?
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Well, c'n we get him back home?
We're due at Andrews.
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
Whaddaya think?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
What are you interested in?
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
Why do they go to War?
Would you go to War to do that?
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it again...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess so.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your ability to fight a Two-ocean War against who?  Sweden and Togo? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has passed.  It's passed.  It's over.  The War of the Future is Nuclear Terrorism.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own governments, have blah blah blah. And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared.  You have to be alert, and the public has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the future, and if you're not gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a drill
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
...you the Press Office?
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Well, that's what we're doing here...
What do you think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean money ...
Then show a little spunk.  There Is no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
When's he coming back...?
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber.
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. TIMES,
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
I'm gonna tell you why...
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does that mean?
Remember the Maine...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking wars.  Y'know why.  Cause it's show business. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, One Shot of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and Posture.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing.
Why not?
They Got To Know?  Stan...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk Driver.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one Smart Bomb falling into a building. The truth, I was in the building when they shot that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
It's not war.  It is a Pageant.  It's a Pageant... Like the Oscars... why we came to you...
N'it's a crying shame.  But you staged the Oscars...
And if you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship...
Well, no, well, you couldn't tell any...
...that's what it is.
Because.
I'm sure they do.
Freedom.
...who is this guy...?
We don't need an Act Two.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
You can't have a war without an enemy.
Well, you could have one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're done in 10 days...
Back End ... count on it.
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
Three-o-three...
President's speech.
No, no, no, no, no after the airport.
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
I saw it on TV.
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
Yeah...?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care how many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with Gold.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for two hours... coming home with Gold.
I think it's fine?
No, it's...  I'll, yes, I'm holding, but...  No, it's ...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
...this the Guy.
Where is he now?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do what?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's corny?  Corny?  Is that the word?  Of course it's corny.  We wouldn't have him say the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked in to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way past it, we're past it -- it's the set-up for...he has got to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in...
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Mmm.
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll tell you why:  you got'em by the balls, Squeeze.  Because Schumann's the Shark.  He's ...Jaws.  You have to tease'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  Bring'em back slow, the President...  No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he might, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em vote for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying home, he's here, he's there... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you watch, ten bucks an hour.  If you help ... if you help, a hundred bucks an hour.
Ain't that the truth.
What am I gonna do?  I'm gonna Fade Away.  What are you gonna do?
Assail your ears for one night.
It's her favorite band.
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and Lindy...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there is an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, Don't forget to Vote...
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
The Albanian Campaign.
...a masterpiece...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the Wheat. Variations include, the kid is a boy, the kid is twins, it's a little dog ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna deal with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to rethink...
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot more of this....
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an ambulance, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, we land, we puttem in the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody else off that jet...what the fuck do I care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
Cause I don't think this dog is gonna hunt....
What kind of stuff?  Hello...?
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't care -- I'm just addicted to it...
Wake up.
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your life, ruin'd your Culture, but...
Y'know what else bothers me?  Shh lil baby
Uh huh...why?
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you going...?
I'm tired.
You can't tell this story.
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
He raped a Nun...
He's doped to the Gills ...
No, I'm On Top of it...
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.
Naw, naw, we own the airways...
No.  You're right.
A proud tradition.
No, I don't think you can do that.
No, I don't think you can do that, Stanley...
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed on.
No, the deal isn't changed.  The Deal isn't changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  Money?  You want Money?
Arnold. What's happening?
You want to work at Carl's?
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Of course.
Don't worry about it.
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Totally.
It's the first door on your left.
I can't find it, mon!
It's the first door on your left!
First door on your left!
There it is!
Easy, mon.
Later.
This is how I dress all the time.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Hi, Brad.
Sis.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
Don't strain yourself.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I'll explain everything later.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Is everything okay at work?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
I'm just guessing.
Well... it's true.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Why?
I don't know. I was just curious.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
You are a virgin!
Are you still a virgin?
Does Mom know you have company?
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
See you later.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
You're not going to tell me, are you?
No.
All right, then. It's your secret.
They were left over from the last shift.
But they weren't mine.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Yes, sir.
Ugh.
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone.
Nice to meet you.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Oh, really?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Get a ride with somebody.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
What a guy.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Mark is a really nice boy...
Do you have any ice tea?
Sure. Come on in.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
I know what I look like.
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Well...
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
Pick a suit.
Come on...
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
He's my friend, too.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
No. Are you crazy?
How about both of us at the same time?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Let's continue.
Hey, Mike?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
What's wrong?
I guess I did.
Oh. Hi.
I didn't see you this morning.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Hello.
What's going on?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
What? Now?
Why don't you call me up tonight?
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
I know it's yours.
Take that back.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
We've got to get an abortion?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Get going.
You should work for yourself.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
It's definitely your mama.
All right... where did you see her?
Did you get her number?
Did you get her name?
I would. Yeah.
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
All right. Pay attention.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
Did you go home and get it?
I'm really pretty busy...
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Poor guy.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Fine. Get lost.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Sensitive -- what is that?
So what makes you so sensitive?
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Yes.
Not if you're over sixteen.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I've been swimming, Merv.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
I don't go at all.
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
That's me, Merv.
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
I thought he was out of town.
Then don't hassle it.
Naw. Any good?
All right.
J. S. Bach.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Ay, there's the rub.  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Gadget guy?  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Always hoping.  Or this...
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Try what?
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
What the fuck is this guy doing?
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
I'll work on it.
Aha!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Limestone quarry?
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Yes.  Now, observe....
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
Now, what was that?
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
What was all that back there?
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Hey, I tried the board.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
That's right... That's good.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Well... that, too.
So... what happened?
Uh... how long ago was this?
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Can you fill me in here?
You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
Oh, damn!  That's it.
It is?
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
What's this?
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
Willard...
It's a town!
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Relax.  We're almost there.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
I adjusted it.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
My pleasure.
What?  President Grant is...!
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
It was in your book.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
My hat is off to you, sir.
God in heaven, what is that?!
My God!  He's so excessive!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
What is this?  A whole new train?
I'm sure we will.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
But it only has six legs.
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Don't you like him?
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
What should I do?
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
So what did you do?
I can't do that.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Really?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
He was hot, wasn't he?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Believe it.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
I know.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What variables?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
What's the big deal?
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Was it great?
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Hey! That's my line!
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Sixteen.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
Climax together.
Does that ever happen?
No. But it's a nice idea.
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
How long does Doug take?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
What do you think?
I think they're both virgins.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
No.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
What do you think it is?
What do you think it is?
It couldn't be.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
What?
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
That little prick.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
That little prick.
I paid for it and everything.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
What do you want?
I want romance.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
Where's Doug?
He's not coming.
Not coming? What happened?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Sometime?
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?!
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
What class?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Really?
Can I come in?
You just ripped my card in two!
Yes.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I don't know.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
You better save some for me, you swine!
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
I don't know. I guess so.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Well, you'll find out next year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
If you graduate.
You're gonna flunk me?!
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Aloha, Spicoli.
I know, everyone says that.
What can I get for you tonight.
Thanks for picking me up.
Thanks. So do you.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
The point sounds fine.
That's a nice shirt.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
What about those other guys you live with?
Yes.
We keep them.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
What's your other question?
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Thanks for coming to get me.
This is a nice car.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I've heard that, too.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Do you want to come inside?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Do you really have to go?
Where's Mike today?
What's April 16th?
John Bonham?
Oh. I see.
I made a fool of myself.
What about the notes?
Hi, Mark.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
What in God's name are you doing?
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
Is it that music?
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Love me oodles and oodles?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Darling!
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
I...
And your passport?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Promise??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Will you miss me?
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Does that mean you love me?
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling.
Darling!
Love me?
Darling!?!
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
What a strange fellow.
Why does he call you 'master'?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Is it worth taking a chance?
That's my good boy.
I beg your pardon?
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Vermicelli.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Nineteen, sir.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Frederick Frankenstein?
Are you putting me on?
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
I see.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Are these your bags?
What hump?
There.
I thought you wanted to.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
The wockers with the knockers.
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Fro-derick!
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
Just putting up some tea.
What?
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
Must be the music room.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Taking the book along?
Could be worse!
Could be raining!
I have a pretty good idea.
Hmm!
That's not bad.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
Thank you, Master.
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
Tonight?
You've got it, master.
This guy means business.
What?
Wait till he sees the bill.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
You'll be getting me sad next.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
Who are you talking to?
It wasn't me.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
Don't fall for that one.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
Original.
You can say that again.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
No, I ' m not.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
No, no!  That whole thing!
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
Yes, Master!
How's it going?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
How do you know it was a 'he'?
Can you play it?
That's what we're paid for.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
What d'ya mean What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
Come on, big fellow!
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
Extremely well.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Are you busy?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Ooh!
Look, Doctor!
Oh, doctor!
And look at this, Doctor!
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Yes!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Oh, Doctor!
I think you've done it, master.
What do you think we should do?
I'd be so nervous.
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
Are you serious??
Good night, Doctor.
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
Not fooling around.
I see what you mean.
I know Frederick.
Of course not.
What?
Nor to Elizabeth.
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
And Elizabeth has hers.
But, after all, you have yours.
And I have mine.
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
Are you ready for me?
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
No, not sound.
There must have been someone else down here then.
His what??
His schwanzstucker.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
I'm getting tired.
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
Look how far we've come.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
How long is it so far?
Four
Three minutes to go!
Yes.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Do Something!  Stall them!
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
We can't risk letting them in.
Careful.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
They'll be back.
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
But it's got teeth.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Hey!
Easy.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
What tunnel? Where?
What's it for?
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Follow me.
We just smeared a skunk.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
We're going to get help.
Anybody else?
What?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
What's in the back?
But not flush against the tunnel?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Well...
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
The girl's got rhythm.
Sure.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
My husband...
He's dead.
What?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Huh?
He shot you the other time.
Will these boards hold?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Good.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
What?
What?
What do you mean what?
Huh?
What's going on between you two?
Nothing.
What's it for!?
Is it gassed up?
Four door?
How many?
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Seven.
Keys.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
'Eh, Chief?
Fine, Chief.
NO, but I will lock you in.
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Move slow and move quiet.
Move it!
Shit!
If he doesn't shut up...
Hurry!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Yeah -- we'll see.
COME ON!
Get something on that.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Let's move.
Nothing, just lookin'.
YOU'LL HIT US!
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
Okay, well that's something.
Hold it!
Wait God-dammit!
Go! Go!
Go!!!
Get to your cars!
That's one piece of four problems.
Stop her!
Let's lock off this room.
All right.
You know you don't have to do this.
I admire your strength.
I think --
What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and angry
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Don't make me do it, man
It's off. The whole thing.
You have my word.  As a gentleman
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
Well good, that's very... nice.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Just don't.
This is it?
Where's my bed?
Is that the bathroom?
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Right... Sorry, sir.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
I'm... I'm shot.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
Don't speak, Quellek.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
Come on, old friend...
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
You WILL go out there.
The show must go on.
...Damn you!  Damn you!
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
God, what an ass.
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
At ease men.
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
We've got to stop!
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
Like YOU know?
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
About this much.
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
THIS much.
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Go ahead!
You go first! There's no time!
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
What?  What?
I heard something. A squeal.
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.. ...Oh
Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Yes. Good was done this .....
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
He's a twit!
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
I played Richard III...
Settle down, Alex...
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
He wants to THINK!?
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
What's happened?
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
You think you could do better Laredo?
Hey, watch that Laredo shit.
And note the sucked in gut.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
You have a better plan, Alex?
The guy is terminally selfish!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Alex you can't -just leave.
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
You could order something in.
A boy comes to the door.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
Oh my god, It's real.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
We heard it the first time!
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
May I get the check?
The ships are gaining...
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Go into the cloud! ...
Alex? Where are you going?
To see if there's a pub.
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
Could they be the miners?
I don't know.
Nobody was WATCHING?
Those blue things ate everybody here?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
Down there.
You said the Commander.
What?
Back there. You said the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals.
No I didn't.
He always has to make the big entrance.
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In The Quasar Dilemma, the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Excuse me guys.
Commander, as I was saying... In The Quasar Dilemma, you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Yes but, we were wondering-
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
... Yes?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
What's  your name, son?
Brandon.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
It's okay. Listen-
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Okay, we got it.
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Okay, so do you see a door marked CORE UNIT? Should be down at the far end to your left.
Yes...?
Okay, that's where you want to be.
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
Yes Commander?
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
What do you mean?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
But you don't?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
How did you come to that conclusion?
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
Okay, now. But-
No, wait, are you-
Shit! Go!
GO Commander.
Go. They're off again.
Up.
What?  Up?
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
That's It?
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from historical document thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
What's the weather like outside?
I never get tired of that joke.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
The enemy is matching velocity.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
It's fractured...
All systems are working, Commander.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Never mind, Fred....
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
You... know us?
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Where are the miners?
Oh, they're so cute.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Your last name.
It's... I don't know.
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
Assault on Voltareck III.  Episode... 31 I think.
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
They're gone.
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
What?
You smiled at me.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
It's Jason...
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
Only answers to me.
But I'm the Commander!
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
Hey... Hey where are you going?
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
Let me think. I need time to think.
There's nobody here. Jason...
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Jason..
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
JASON...
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
I thought It was the We're dead gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
I don't think that's a cloud...
Are they behind us?
Computer, can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
I could have held on to YOU! ...
Don't be ridiculous.
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Why does this sound so familiar?
How does the rolling help, actually?
It helps.
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Thank God. Are you okay?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
What?  What did he say?
Nothing. Hold please.
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Turn on the translation circuit.
What the hell are you talking about?
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
Gwen...
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Because it was on the show!
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Mark 12.
never doubted you for a second.
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
You're kidding. When for?
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
You are so full of shit
You gotta admit, they do love him.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
That's it, It's go time.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
You know, that's really getting annoying.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Sure, no problem.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... Digitize me
I heard it too.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
Closer?  I can try.
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
Yes.
I don't know.
Stop, please! I don't know!
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
We pretend...
We.. We lie.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Catch me later, okay?
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
As you wish.
Home.
You... You mean Earth?
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Theramin.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
But what if Sarris survives?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
Weapons storage...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
NO, Thank God he has not.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Former Commander?
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
Commander...
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
Mathesar? What is that?
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
You makin' any headway?
Where?
Deception... Lies.
Well... Sort of...
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
But there it is!...
A model, only as big as this.
But... Inside, I have seen-
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
I didn't say that.  I said wouldn't it be great if we could always
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
What's going on?
Excuse me?
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
Where?
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Could be this.
Push It. Hold it down.
Do your best, Tommy...
Oh god...
Anything.
Okay, I'll do this...  Caw Caw!
Tommy, we have these...
Oh, right, sorry.
Okay, let's go.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
How about the pig-lizard?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
NO NO NO.
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Practice driving, Tommy.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Pedal to the metal...
Let's do it, Tommy.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
Hold course, Laredo!
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
What's the worst?
You get the girl.
What is this?
You're kidding me, right?
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
You see that? The way the man just went right over?
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
I guess still in the locker.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I mean I don't care.
You see the paper?
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Who?
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
Come here, Farrah...
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
Farrah. Come here.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
What about him?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
You get the money?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
Trade for what?
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
You get life for kidnapping.
Calm down, Bear...
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
And that's for the airport.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
You're right.
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
So you didn't have the key with you.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
So... how many movies you been in?
About sixty.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Your who?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
He's around someplace.
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
Harry, let me answer that.
You can talk to me.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
That's right, me.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie Fingers.
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than Lovejoy.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
There's Ilona.
Get something going there.
She's... young.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
Who?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
That's all.
I really think I can be of service on this one.
I need the money.
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Tell you what...
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
Karen? You okay?
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
I'll find it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Gimme an hour.
Where's Karen?
In the can. That the money?
She's great. Gimme the money.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
What?
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Bear, you're not really gonna Ã»-
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of Freaks and put 'em in this other one, Mr. Loverboy.
You positive about that?
It's a different kind of deal.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people Ã»-
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
I'm working on a few things.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
You serious?
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Leo, I don't know.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
The airport.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
I don't know.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
That's the magic number.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Ray Barboni?
Who is this?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Depends. Who's this?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
What three hundred grand?
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Okay. So who are you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Never heard of him.
Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Or else what?
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Ray. Look at me.
What?
You say look at you?
That's correct. Look at me.
How'd you get in here?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Yeah? Which terminal?
Sovereign.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I like it here.
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -Ã» I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -Ã» forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Whatever you want, Ray.
I don't like waiting.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
That's right.
I'm a producer.
Not yet. I just started.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
What've you got?
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Have we met? I don't recall.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
I'm looking at you.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
That's what I'm doing.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
I know what a marker is.
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I want you to.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Come on, Harry -Ã» Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
Fuckin' basketball game.
You make movies, huh?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
Keep going.
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
So he comes to L.A...
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
That's it? That's your movie?
I said I had an idea, that's all.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You mean, Leo?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
But you work for the casino?
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
So you don't work for the casino?
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
They always paid.
Once.
Really? You ever been arrested?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -Ã» this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer Ã»-
Harry, look at me.
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
For a movie?
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my Driving Miss Daisy.
What's it called?
Mr. Lovejoy.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's the title?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in The Cyclone.
One of his best parts.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Ride the Clouds. Good picture.
She looks familiar.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
So what's the problem?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
He drown?
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -Ã»
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
Read it. It's a grabber.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
You're kidding, right?
What?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell 'em something.
Never say anything unless you have to.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Hey, Harry.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Really.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
I found him.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
You have it?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Yeah, he told me.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Ask your man here.
Twenty seven hundred.
Yeah. That was a good party.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
We talk different?
You mean like we don't give a shit.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
With what? Wiseguy money?
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Martin, look at me.
Like this?
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
Wait. How about this?
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
How about this?
That's not bad.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I believe it.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
How do I know that?
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Okay. I'm listening.
Hey -- do you mind?
Not at all
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Buddy?
Very nice...
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
What's that?
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
You've been losing.
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
Sit down, Leo.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I'll find you, Leo...
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
The door from the patio, in back.
You broke in?
What if it was?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
I know what a vig is.
That's right. Three percent.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
A real bargain.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
How much is the wife offered?
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
What're you doing here?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Rough day on the set?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons Ã»-
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
...That's what we finally decided.
Like in Bride of the Mutant, when you played the whole end with that torn top.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in Mildred Pierce -Ã» which by the way was a better book than a movie -Ã» did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
He must mean after Slime Creature 3.
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
Right. See how your story ends.
Yeah. Right.  Listen, Touch of Evil's playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
You been here the whole time?
I got you a copy of the script.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
What do you think?
I think it's not horrible.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
What do you get out of it?
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Depends, who pays?
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You thought I was faking?
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -Ã»
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
Harry... My God...
What happened?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Why not?
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
I'll go. I'll go.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
Were you scared up there?
Go get your stuff.
What took you so long?
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
That's what the guy said.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
I told you not to -Ã»
Don't say a fuckin' word.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
Pick 'n' Save.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
Hello, Doris.
Come on in.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
How honorable of you.
What's wrong?
Be quiet and listen.
I don't hear anything.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I don't have a dog.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Harry -Ã»
I'm going.
How did you get in the house?
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
That's where you got the idea?
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
'We?'
Chili and me.
Harry -Ã»
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Which two?
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Mob guy?
What money?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Shylock?
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Really.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Oh, for Christ's sake Ã»-
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey Ã»-  This your ride, Chili?
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
And after all, you have such morals.
Where ya goin?
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Will you get off my back for once?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Who?
Guess.
How should I know?
Someone from the past.
Who?
Give up?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
God, how horrifying.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Are you still looking for a job?
I guess.
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
What?
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Yeah, I heard about that.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
What do you mean on his way up!?
I just buzzed him in.
But I can't --
JUST DO IT!
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
No, really I --
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I see... interesting...
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Did you actually do this painting?
Well, no - it's more like a found art object.
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Uh-oh.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
...wow...
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
I...
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
What do you mean?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
You can count on me, sir!
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Jesus...
